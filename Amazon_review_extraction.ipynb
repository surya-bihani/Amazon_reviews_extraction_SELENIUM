The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair.\\n\\nRedmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, battery\\n\\nGames like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth.\\n\\nThe only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device.\\n\\nThe Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well.\\n\\nRedmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, Display\\n\\nThe Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible.\\n\\nThe positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots.\\n\\nThe display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.\\n172 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\n4 Comments Report abuse\\nSreenivasa Reddy\\nFacing heat issue and picture quality is low\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nI observed that this phone is getting heat when you use more than 5-10 min for calls/camera/ video.

But No support for Data Transfer\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nGlad to be the first one to write a review for this phone! The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image.\\nThe Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images.\\nIt is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does!\\n\\nActually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android!\\n\\nAbout the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won\\'t help at all in any transfer of data.\\n\\nPlease note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!\\n\\nAll in all a good phone for first-time buyers (considering the camera specs and price point), but a clear NO for migration! Also if you don\\'t want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy, check, decide and return then please note that it doesn\\'t work!\\n56 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\n1 Comment Report abuse\\nGaman\\nTrue game changer Nd market gainer\\nReviewed in India on 8 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\n# Mi love .....

On the very first sale in bought this mobile. When I removed the tampered (plastic covering screen ) there were scratches on the screen. I wonder what happened to the control check of xiaomi? How can they so carelessly sell the mobile without proper inspection? This reflects how customer oriented they are! About the phone functioning I cannot comment any thing as I did not use it more than 20 minutes . But one thing is for sure, if things are sold without proper inspection and quality check, what being a customer we receive is going to be a \"CRAP\".\\n46 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAbhijeet Petewar\\nSensor problem in this phone ....

What my concern was it\\'s battery ,maybe the g90t is power hungry and 4500mah lasts almost a day..I wished it to last for the next half too.

The camera bump at the back protrudes a little even when the cover is on, may be a matter of concern. Please look for a Silicon cover to protect the camera module.\\n\\nPROCESSOR - This houses the newest chipset from MediaTek Helio G90T which is basically designed for gaming. This not only helps the phone to load & play high graphic intensive games fast & smooth, but it also helps in quick loading and swapping of Apps in a day to day usage. The overall performance is amazingly fast and buttery. Those who are complaining of heating issues, should buy ACs before buying phones for playing games for hours..\\n\\nSTORAGE & RAM - This comes with the fast UFS 2.1 onboard storage that help load apps ultra-fast, as compare to old eMMC 5.1 type storage. The basic model starts with 6 GB LPDDR4 RAM with Dual Channel Enabled. This helps increase the bandwidth by double the data rate as against the single channel RAM. Everything loads amazingly fast with no lags as such.\\nSupports up to a whopping 512 GB of storage with a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. This is what we want in every phone‚Ä¶\\n\\nDISPLAY - 6.53‚Äù IPS LCD Panel with 395 PPI density and 2.5D curved edges. This display is of a 1080 x 2340 Resolution with HDR Enabled so the colors look very vibrant and true to life. The water drop notch looks very nice and it can be disabled from settings. Personally, to me the display looked very crisp and sharp. The brightness of this display can go up to 430nits which is very bright and display looks amazingly sharp and crisp‚Ä¶ 4k HDR video quality on YouTube is amazing on this display...\\n\\nCAMERA - This is where it exceeds all other phones. The default 12 MP Camera takes nice pictures in all modes. The 64 MP mode can be enabled from the camera app and it captures amazing pictures with great clarity colours and contrast. The pictures with 64 MP camera come out to be very crisp and with lots of details. But the image size for 64 MP camera would be approximately around 15 MB per picture. This can record the videos up to 4k Resolution. However, Full HD videos will have an Electronic Stabilization enabled by default which produces great videos. Macros also come very crisp considering that this is a Mobile camera but, not the DSLR.\\nFront 20 MP Camera also captures wonderful selfies with lots of detail. This can record videos up to Full HD resolution. This phone does a great job in Camera department. This will surely satisfy your hunger for great pictures‚Ä¶\\nThose who are looking for Gcam support, should take mobiles that support it or should buy google phones instead of complaining about this phone.

PUBG- pubg lovers if you want a phone specially for pubg dont let thsis phone go .excellent gaming\\n5. heating issue?- only if you use this phone for long time with continous gaming.and with high graphics. otherwise no issue even you watch a full movie with wifi. only while gaming after one hour on full hd graphics\\n6. display- butter smooth display quit large and excellent display best in claass but will not produce colours as super amoled just a littel bit of diferrence between the two but you will not find much differance in day to day life . so full marks for display\\n7. battery- i will say a decent battery life considering 6.5 inch display and a a heavy processor\\ncamera?- this is the biggest of alll and i am giving you a detailed review for this. camera is superb no doubt even in low light it performes vary well and after zooming the photos you will not get blur images at all. potrait mode is one of the best in this segments .\\nbut now the cons of camera\\nslow motion and wide camera are poor. vary poor quality i am not impressed at all. slow motion video you can capture only from short or close distance otherwise not good at all and even you cant shoot in artificial lights is well. and wide camera does not produces good quality pictures. macro camera is excellent.\\nand the last con of camera i compaired this camera with iphone xr and vivo v15pro . in terms of details it is totally equall to them but colours of the pics is not that great but decent in comaprison you will find colours bitt dull but that does not mean they are better . they only produces better colour otherwise same. but one thing to notice both iphone and vivo captures the colour more saturated than orignal even they dont produces real colours. redmi shows littel light colours than real and xr iphone and vivo littel dark than orignal .camera is vary good and you will get good pictures and for colour you can adjust them with some photo editing. so no issues. final verdict on camera is .that it is a good camera and you will not be disspointed\\nworth the money you spend\\ngreat display good camera good battery good built quality\\nlittel heavy, sound lacks dolby quality.camera slow motion and wide angel not good\\ni will say only compititor for this phone is Vivo z1x in this price segment.\\nyou can buy any of this phone depends on your demands\\n20 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nVinod vekariya\\nPower house\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nBest\\n26 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nPunkesh Kumar\\nNice phone\\nReviewed in India on 7 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nIt is fablus phone under budget.\\nNote 8 pro phone performance is good.\\nBattery backup is good.\\nCamera is very good.\\n22 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nShinde Suyash S\\nBest gaming performance.....\\nReviewed in India on 13 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe performance was best....but phone is heavy as compared to other ....\\n25 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nNetwork issue..

It is good even in dark. Though depth of the pic feature is good, the zoom is only available till 2x.\\n\\nThe battery works really well. If you charge to 100%, it should last for over 24 hours on moderate usage. Fast charging is available.\\n\\nSince RAM is on the higher side, it is good for gaming enthusiasts.\\n\\nThe display is crisp and the software is smooth.\\n\\nIt is tough to grab this one because of the excessive demand. The best part is that even the waitlist gets full within few minutes of the start of the sale.\\n14 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nmir a.\\nGreat buy.\\nReviewed in India on 9 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nAfter 10 days of use...\\nPros\\n1.

First of all, Package I received was not as shown in product description. Cover and adapter cable was missing, phone I added to cart was green and I got was black. Phone is too heavy and still the battery life is not that good. Fingerprint scanning is slow.\\nCamera is good but display not. Spending 16000 just for good camera is not worth.\\nSamsung M30 is recommended over this phone.

However phone has performance and technical issues. I faced 2 technical issues\\na) Proximity sensor is faulty, when sensor is on the screen goes off immediately after call is received or placed. Once screen is off you can\\'t wake the screen by pressing on button or double tap or through finger print sensor. Screen only activates once the call is disconnected by other person. Due to this we cannot make calls to IVR as we don\\'t get screen to select options\\n\\nb) Finger print sensor does not work if you are activating phone after 2 to 3 hours, once you have activated using on button then onwards finger print sensor will respond\\n\\nc) Some of the text in widgets some.up in Chinese when all other text is in English.\\n\\nd) had experienced lag prior to installing updates\\n\\nExcept above 4 issues this is an excellent phone.\\n8 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nLokesh\\nWast of money\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nWast of money ..proximate sensor problem in my mobile it\\'s a big problem.

At least on paper. In the real world, there is a boost in gaming performance and display quality while the added Alexa integration will be welcomed by some. The camera quality remains more or less the same despite a newer sensor, and that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. Addressing a few burning issues, we initially concluded the Note 8 Pro might be overheating during longer gaming sessions. While the phone does run warmer than say the Realme 5 Pro, it doesn‚Äôt go beyond 50 degrees, which is what we consider overheating in smartphones. The battery life of the phone is just as good as its predecessor, despite a larger battery. By the looks of it, Xiaomi took a bold step by choosing to go with a MediaTek flagship SoC and it seems to have paid off. There‚Äôs no reason why shouldn‚Äôt buy the Redmi Note 8 Pro, save for the pesky ads in the UI.\\n#redmi #mi\\n6 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nNikhil songara\\n#redmi‚ù§Ô∏è\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\n#redmi‚ù§Ô∏è#Mi‚ù§Ô∏è the best smart phone ever it has many extra features that are very usable in smartphone and i hope all the people like this phone i am in love with note 8 proo‚ù§Ô∏è\\n9 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nlakshmikanth\\nAwesome mobile\\nReviewed in India on 8 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nWonderful mobile\\n11 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nRam Shankar yadav\\nAwesome purchase..\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nProduct is overall very good..\\nSome cons..\\nDisplay good but if it would be super Amloed then this will be better.\\nFront camera should be improved too.\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nTejas Jarande\\nüí£üí£üî´üî´PUBGüî´üî´üí£üí£\\nReviewed in India on 13 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nBEST FOR PUBGü§©....GAMERS DON\\'T WAIT.....AIMING IS DONE VERY EASY...GRAFICS 10 ON 10 .....BEST EXPERIENCE TO PLAY PUBG....BATTERY GOOD....8 GAMES OF CLASSIC MODE IN 80%CHARGING .....TDM IS JUST ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞.....KILLING 20 IN EACH GAME....\\n9 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nutpalkumar sursinhbhai vasava\\nCamera quality poor bhangar\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nCamera quality poor\\nFingerprint good\\nBattery life good\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

It highlights every spot on your face n even the sweat n oil though you smoothen the pics. Beautify option is not good as 5pro or 6 pro. Battery dries out very soon n takes too much time to change.. i was using Redmi note 5 pro.. that Phone\\' battery life is better than this phone.. Too many adds in every app, no option to shut them. Phone is quite heavy, it\\'s definitely not for people with small palms.the cover provided with phone is pathetic, does not cover camera very well unlike the cover provided with 5 pro. One drop & camera glass willl break for sure.. Good for gaming.. pubg runs very smooth and graphics looks amazing..but it drains the battery in 2 games.. in previous version we had finger touch option for taking pics.

After 1S I had used many Xiaomi smartphones from Redmi Note 3, Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 5, Redmi 2 Prime, Mi 4i, Mi A2, Poco F1, Redmi Note 7, Redmi Note 7 Pro and Mi 5. But first time ever I am disappointed with any Xiaomi smartphone and that phone is none other than Redmi Note 8 Pro. I had even visited Redmi Note 8 Pro launch event and there they showcased this smartphone that good that I wanted to purchase it. So finally I did buy the phone thinking about all these features like cooling pipe, gaming-centric smartphone and all. But finally, after spending that much money it was all worthless as the phone screen was not that good buying it for Rs 15K. Ignoring the screen camera was disgusting. And most importantly phone was getting heated as well while playing PUBG only for about 30 minutes which is disgusting to spend this much and getting nothing. And the most disgusting was that I had gone with the Halo White color which does looks shabby and cheap smartphone without cover. So either covers it forever or use it hiding with everyone.\\nLast words never go for this smartphone ever. This was disgust phone ever which looked shabby, bulky and overpriced.\\n4 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nKRISHNA\\nRocking note 8 pro\\nReviewed in India on 7 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nLove it\\n11 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nJyoti prakash\\nGood\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nVery good.\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nYash-Delhi\\nTotal value for money\\nReviewed in India on 11 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nBought recently, using for few days now. Sharing initial impressions for assistance:\\n*Screen quality is really good, i have been using amoleds but not disappointed with this lcd, blacks are very good for lcd even thought the contrast ratio mentioned is around 13k but totally satisfied with the contrast, colors etc. It even out shined my older samsung a9 pro with its hdr videos in you tube.\\n*Gaming is good, played asphalt 9 for few hours at max settings and did not find much lags and the game is enjoyable without much heating either.\\n*Battery standby is v.good - no loss in standby even in night, not even 1%, even thought the screen & android consumes a bit more battery than desired but still its nice and fast charging is also fine.\\n*Built quality is super - got white color and loved it, i wanted green but couldn\\'t get that in sale so have to buy white but have to say it is very good. I love the curves in the side which makes handling a pleasure & use big phones so i needed big size and could have gone for bigger also but not disappointed with this size also, pretty good. The weight is also ideal with not more than 200 which doesn\\'t feel heavy.\\n*Finger print is fast and face is reliable and fast without opening in eyes closed case.\\n*UI is fast and filled with customization, i downloaded poco launcher instantly as i needed app drawer and its great.\\n*Both cameras are ok in indoor lighting not very great as i could not use it outdoors yet.\\nThanks xiaomi for this great product and such price and thanks amazon for getting the same in just 2 days time without any extra charges.\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Having been the brand that has stood at the summit of India\\'s smartphone market for eight straight quarters, the company certainly doesn\\'t want to lose out relative newbies.\\n\\n3)Realme, meanwhile, is breaking records of its own, gaining a market share of 9% within just 15 months of existence. So does the Redmi Note 8 Pro do enough to warrant the spotlight for yet another iteration? Read on to find out.\\n,Build and Design\\n\\n4)The Redmi Note 8 Pro is hands-down the most attractive looking Redmi Note series phone till date. It\\'s striking but not over the top and that\\'s precisely why I\\'ve loved how Xiaomi\\'s gone about the design here. It\\'s also worth noting that Xiaomi\\'s typically been a brand that doesn\\'t revise their product designs often enough. They changed that with the Redmi Note 7 Pro earlier this year and eight months down the line, they\\'ve changed it up again: this time, adding it a little more oomph to the mix.\\n\\nA Good Display That Could Have Been Better\\n\\nOn the front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro gets a 6.53-inch FHD+ IPS LCD panel. The screen itself is seemingly identical to what Xiaomi fielded in this segment earlier this year, and you get decent colors and zero issues with sunlight legibility. But when you pay attention to competition though, namely, the Realme XT, you do get an AMOLED screen that has more vibrant colors.\\n\\nThe reason why the comparison between LCD and OLED comes up every time is because black levels and contrast aren‚Äôt exactly as good on an LCD panel as the AMOLED screen on the Realme XT. However, the difference in quality isn‚Äôt huge either. The panel on the Redmi Note 8 Pro is just as good as LCD panels get and if you\\'re someone who streams a ton of video content on your phone, you\\'ll definitely have a great experience.\\n\\nRedmi Note 8 Pro: Performance and Software\\n\\nXiaomi definitely raised eyebrows when they decided to go with a Mediatek SoC in the Note 8 Pro despite the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 doing an excellent job in the Redmi Note 7 Pro. In fact, it was a big risk and the scales could have tipped either way. But as it turns out, this was a brilliant decision on Xiaomi‚Äôs part as the Mediatek Helio G90T delivers every ounce of muscle you\\'d expect from it and more. This is by far the most powerful on any phone priced under INR 17-18,000, one that certainly caters to all the PUBG-walas out there.\\n\\nRedmi Note 8 Pro: You Didn\\'t Need To Throw In Four Cameras In There Xiaomi\\n\\nRear:\\n\\n64MP f/1.79 Primary\\n8MP f/2.2 Ultra-wide angle lens\\n2MP Macro Lens with focus upto 2cm\\n2MP depth sensor\\n\\nFront: 20MP f/2.0 Selfie shooter\\n5 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nrejul\\nHeat sink does not work\\nReviewed in India on 13 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nHeating issues\\nPhone always heats\\nThe right top corner always heats for above 45¬∞c\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nPatil V.\\nMy expirance since I am using it from 23 oct.

No calls attended, no gaming, used data for just updating apps and installation. I would say my usage is below average and still i am facing this issue. Even I do have redmi note 7 pro bought from flipkart and it\\'s been 1 year and the performance and battery backup is better than this. Watching cricket on hotstar, took 5 calls for 2, 3 hrs long and still it has 65% battery. I am sure this is a defective product and customer care doesn\\'t care ....I called them 3 times and they told me to perform battery calibration test I did that and already factory data rest and clear the caches still it is draining way too fast. They have provided me a defective piece and not letting me return or replace. On asking they told me that they have to follow procedure and will send technician and he will not be available till 27. I asked them to speak to their supervisor and as expected I was told that all the seniors are busy right now. Very dissappointed with amazon.

I can\\'t type with full speed. Whenever I type with maximum speed it starts typing anything randomly, I mean the random keys. Now please don\\'t even try to tell me if I don\\'t have enough typing speed. I\\'ve never faced any such issues with any of my phones. For the comparison I tried with my Bro\\'s n frineds IP11pro max M40 and OP8Pro I\\'ve tried with them all but i\\'ve got no such issue. I\\'m so much disappointed. Phone has no other issue..its just awesome in every other department. Camera battery performence you name it.\\nEdit1:Its been 9 months the performance is still undoubtedly great. The only thing that concerns me is the screen that doesn\\'t capture the touches when we type faster than a certain wpm.. So the typing problem is still there.. Now i have activated autocorrection and it does require its work in 9 of 10 words I type. I have thrown my phone twice in frustration because of this Sh√Øt. I\\'m using Touchscreen since 2009.\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nmanu chandrawanshi\\nExcelente\\nReviewed in India on 11 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nAwesome product I\\'ll fallen loved‚ù§üòçüòç\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nsandeep bansal\\nBest midrange smartphone:Period!!!\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nI usually don\\'t review products on Amazon, but this one deserves special mention; so here we go..\\nIn the Box: You get handset, 18 Watt fast Charger, and a Cover, no screen guard inside the box...\\n\\nThe cover: deserves an especial mention- it\\'s similar to OnePlus 7 cover and has that USB flap to protect phone from water damage...\\n\\nThe Handset: White looks almost magical; there are 2 trays side by side, which can accommodate 2 sims and a MicroSD. On the top, you will find an IR blaster, nothing new if you are a returning Xiaomi customer, but if this is your first, then just use it once and see how handy it is in controlling TV, AC and other remote control appliances...\\nBottom has a single speaker grill, 3.5mm Jack and USB Type-C...\\n\\nSwitching On: It gives a haptic feedback which is quite tuned rather than the rude vibration that Redmi Note 5 pro gives, Xiaomi has worked hard to fine tune the device and it has paid well. Now starts the real torment: There are tons of options guiding you to customize the phone as you prepare for our maiden voyage and options for Ads are kinda well hidden, but more about it later.\\n\\nUI: Now let your eyes and mind get accustomed to MIUI; there\\'s no app drawer and all apps are neatly grouped into folders. there\\'s a lot of bloat, but thank the sweet Lord it\\'s uninstallable. I would advise you to enable developer options and reduce the animations to 0.5X; the phone will be noticeably faster and less animated...\\n\\nDisplay: The HDR display is vibrant and bezels are negligible; one of the best ever seen on Redmi Note series...\\n\\nCamera: Of course, it\\'s the camera phone with monstrous 64MP primary sensor; my initial impressions were good but camera tends to saturate dark colors quite a bit, and Wide Angle has quite noticeable distortion; Scared yet? Don\\'t be cuz even after these caveats, the camera performs well specially with pro-mode; do not use 64 MP mode, the noise increases quite a bit...\\n\\nGCam: Here\\'s our sweet savior again; Xiaomi has left Camera 2 api enabled, so installing GCam is pretty easy; right now, the best one has been developed by Wyroczen and you can find all about it by a single Google search; the GCam corrects most errors of he camera but do not use macro mode; it\\'s much better on stock Camera...\\n\\nSpeakers: The single speaker doesn\\'t really satisfy people who\\'ve used Stereo speakers, but this fact can\\'t take away the limelight off Note 8 pro; the speaker is loud, crisp and has a good bass due to bigger cavity...\\n\\nConnectivity: It is quite good and works fine; haven\\'t seen 4G+ or carrier aggregation though...\\n\\nVerdict: Redmi Note 8 Pro is a fine phone with little to compromise upon; Surely a great effort from Xiaomi once again...\\nPS: Pardon any typos.\\n4 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nsamy\\nPubG gaming 45 degrees.. amaozn says its ok üòÇ\\nReviewed in India on 10 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nJust want to inform all the buyers..

I don\\'t find much difference in camera quality but software and buttons are different though. Alexa is what I like but have to configure it . Busy with phone configuration....will write more after further use.\\nNow it\\'s 8 months now the phone is working great . Played all the heavy games like pubg and other. Performance wise it\\'s great. But little disappont ment with the camera picture quality although the phone is having 64 megapixel but picture looks very unnatural. Like some extra work is done after the picture clicked by its AI.\\nPerformance is good\\nCamera is also good\\nGraphics also great\\nPhone cover turns yellow , after a while.\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nDipika\\nAwesome ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nAwesomeness\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAshish mishra\\nRedmi note 8 pro Great phone\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nMi again proven they are cham in this mid range segment amazing everything is so perfect awesome camera n powerful processor\\n8 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nKUMER MEENA\\nThanks\\nReviewed in India on 7 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nBest phone in price\\n10 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nVikas\\nNice\\nReviewed in India on 7 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nNice mobile\\n9 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Even though it uses Mediatek chip (which is cheap and inferior to Snapdragons), it runs all of its 8 cores on stable 2GHz, not like others which have 2 cores running at 2.5GHz and rest of the 6 are at 1.5. Better buy the 8GB RAM version to get the most out of it, because This Mediatek chip somehow performs at par (or even better) than Snapdragon processors that come within the similar price range. However, it doesn\\'t always run at full speed, but only when needed. This gives some problems like occasional lags when quickly opening high-memory apps while phone is in calm mode for too long.\\n\\n2. Liquid cooled: Again, for this price range it\\'s amazing. However, you need to keep the phone covered with plastic case (comes in the box) to make it work flawlessly. It\\'s because the heat from your hands can easily get transferred to the inside fluid and interfere with convection currents that keep the phone cool. Using a plastic cover helps insulate it.\\n\\n3. Multiple Antennae: The 3G/4G cellular reception on this phone is so good that you\\'re practically never out of signal in the areas where most people struggle to get a single bar. Although it\\'s aimed for gamers who need stable connection for online gaming, it\\'s a big boon for everything else. Wifi/Hotspot works way better than any other phone.\\n\\n4. Large battery, Out-of-Box Fast Charger and USB type C: Again, for a phone this cheap, it\\'s a steal. Battery lasts VERY long because they didn\\'t just pump this phone with fast CPU and large battery, but the way this phone handles everything is actually very efficient that gives you smooth experience while keeping the battery running for long. There are some noticeable glitches though, like sometimes phone takes a while to go from battery-saving to full performing mode and that creates lags. But thankfully, those lags aren\\'t uncommon even in most expensive android phones, so for this small price, you should live with it. Because your other option for total zero lag free experience would be to spend 10x money and buy the iPhone 11, and once Apple releases new iOS, that will start lagging too.\\n\\n5. Cameras: This phone has 5 total cameras. While most of them weren\\'t necessary and are uselessly overhyped, the main reasons to buy this are:\\na.) The color/contrast you get in the final clicked picture of 16MP that combines the data from multiple sensors - this is unmatched and you\\'ll love the pictures shot in regular photo mode.\\nb.) The pro mode with manual controls (32-sec shutter @3200ISO) for main camera and stable lens focus (even without OIS) - best for astrophotography. MacroLens works best in Pro mode where you can get nearest focus for some very detailed microscopic shots. You also get other stuff like metering control, pocket mode where it locks screen while still recording, peak overlay to show you what\\'s in focus and what\\'s not, timelapse with control over intervals [manual controls don\\'t apply to front camera, and for other two sensors, shutter speed is very limited and final pictures are very blurry and have no detail whatsoever at ISO higher than 400. the camera app is native to Redmi software and doesn\\'t support timelapse in manual mode; and other apps like CameraFV-5 don\\'t work so well with bracketing/timelapse... proshot doesn\\'t work at all. you can shoot timelapse in native app but then you won\\'t get manual controls, which is useless for night]\\nc.) All sensors are larger than usual phone sensors, which means better details in low light in all modes [but it doesn\\'t mean they all capture good detail. the macro lens gives worst images and ultrawide isn\\'t any good at all if you want detailed images. only the main sensor with its pixel binning does the actual job]\\nd.) 1080p@120fps and 720p@240fps video encoded in x265 - fast and efficient [rest of slowmo modes are low performing, misguided and not very useful. 960fps mode is there, but it captures only 4 seconds of footage, with the 960fps slowmo applied only to the last 1 second - you have to time your shot very precisely to get it right. there\\'s no sound alert for when it will begin slowmo. also, it isn\\'t native 960fps, more like 480fps with merged frames to make it look like 960fps - capture very fast moving objects like shooting an arrow from bow, or vibrating guitar string and you\\'ll get the artifacts that make it look so fake and ugly]\\nStill, there are things where Redmi could have utilized their budget somewhere else - like Macro lens and Ultrawide aren\\'t very practical. Not just for this phone, but they aren\\'t practical in most phones (Ultrawide gives you wider view but distorts the periphery and people in edges), and in this phone, both Ultrawide and Macro lenses use low-res sensors (2MP for Macro and 8MP for UW), and they aren\\'t good in low light, and even in full daylight they give much lesser detail and color/contrast than the main sensor. and the 64MP\\'s full 64MP don\\'t look any good when zoomed in to 100%, so don\\'t expect to get sharp images from small sectors of a full 64MP photo. But it helps create a very sharp and detailed 16MP photo by combining pixels from 64MP sensor with data from other two cameras, which is kinda better than most expensive phones can do. Also, separating foreground from background is done VERY good (probably because of its AI-learning and 4-camera depth information - works well for front camera too). It can even separate individual hair strands in some cases if lighting is good and subject doesn\\'t move - which is at par with what iPhone 11 Pro does with 3-camera unit.\\n\\n6. Operating System and functions: Usually the custom-Android builds kind of tarnish the performance, but that isn\\'t the case with this phone. Here\\'s what I liked about it:\\na. it gives the freedom to use your own launcher homescreen app (which many other custom-UI Androids don\\'t provide).\\nb. The gaming mode is one of the best things about it - when playing fullscreen games like PUBG/ClashOfClans etc, you can swipe a corner and use Whatsapp/Facebook and Browser in small sidebar like area without leaving the game! even keyboard turns into short, floating version to help typing while keeping the game under eye. There is also a neat option to turn off display while keeping the game running without locking your phone.\\nc. You can record the screen while gaming (which is fast and doesn\\'t stress the system performance while recording) [but during the recording mode, the audio get desynced from what\\'s going on in the game. this also happens if you connect wireless headphones or cast the screen to your TV/monitor. but this isn\\'t a RedMi issue. it happens in every device when you record/cast audio or video wirelessly]\\nd. Fingerprint sensor works flawlessly, there are no mismatches so far as I\\'ve used. Hope it stays that way.\\ne. Native call recorder in calling screen which records both your voice and caller\\'s voice in neat detail (unlike most phones where you can\\'t hear other person in recording unless they\\'re on speaker)\\n\\nFinal Verdict: A great phone to have for this price. It isn\\'t just a cheap phone because price is cheap. It\\'s actually a good device with good battery and smooth performance everywhere. There are some areas where RedMi could\\'ve done better instead of putting four cameras, but then again you\\'re getting what other phones can\\'t give you even at double the price so I shouldn\\'t be complaining about this at all. :)\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAkarsh Rastogi\\nWorst Phone buying decision, SD Card not working\\nReviewed in India on 3 January 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nI had a Redmi Note 5 pro all this while, without any sort of issues for more than 1.5 years, hence I trusted Xiaomi and decided to upgrade. This mobile has given me issues since I have bought it.\\n\\nSD Card NOT WORKING - It\\'s probably been only 20 days and it\\'s automatically unmounting the sd card after a minute of switching the phone on. I need to replace or get full refund, I bought this phone for primarily a dedicated sd card slot.\\n\\nCamera - Very poor. Just a marketing gimmick. The AI obliterates the colours, inaccurate depth sensing and poor actual resolution literally just spoils all photos and videos. RN5pro was smooth inspite of a lower pixelled camera.\\n\\nBattery - Very average. Takes 2+ hours to charge, finishes in less than a day of minimal usage. Drains very fast on heavy use.\\n\\nGPS - Very slow and inaccurate, offilne maps doesn\\'t work ever with just GPS. RN5p was slick and accurate.\\n\\nAll in all the only things I bought this phone for are useless.

Everytime I placed a phone call the network turned off in between and the call used to get disconnected. Got a replacement just now and I hope I don\\'t face the same issue again.\\n\\nApart from that gaming is great but there are definitely heating issues only when you play on the highest settings and I think that Is normal.

I\\'ve owned Redmi More 4/5/6 as well asking with buying multiple other variants for my family.\\n\\nTHIS IS BY FAR THE WORST XIAOMI PHONE. The phone is full of bugs with no resolution. E.g.\\n- *ALL my SMS disappeared overnight*. This is common issue (Google it)\\n- NO WIFI - Post miui 11 update, my wifi keeps showing \"connecting\" or \"limited connectivity\". I\\'m using my old Redmi Note 4 for Amazon Prime/YouTube/ other videos on same wifi\\n- BATTERY: The 4000 mah battery doesn\\'t last as much as Redmi Note 6 even though it made phone so heavy. I come back home from office with 20% odd battery\\n- CAMERA: Removed regular slow Mo from camera. Wide angle, 2x zoom quality is poor. Camera speed is a joke as it keeps changing exposure / focus even millisecond. Removed fingerprint click for selfie. Night mode is a useless. Pro mode is what I bought it for and is good\\n- ADS: Ads within miui in cleaner, video player, file manager and every default app will drive you crazy\\nOTHERS:\\n- Dates of camera pictures changed on their own. So now they are not in right order and difficult to find\\n- Pictures disappeared in gallery. Showing in file manager\\n- Randomly it decides that some photos can\\'t be moved to albums\\n- Auto rotate keeps jumping even after calibration\\n\\nThere are some positives, but many more bugs that I haven\\'t listed and bad experience far outweighs the positives.\\n\\nI regret buying this phone and that Xiaomi is not coming with solutions.

Battery life. Guys the battery is huge n after one charge previous morning n one full day of heavy usage it\\'s still showing 36% of juice left in it.\\n2. Fingerprint Reader. It\\'s as good as they come...no problem whatsoever...works like a dream...\\n3. Design. Staple MI design, the quad cam setup with finger print reader is perfectly positioned...it\\'s not premium but hey I\\'m not complaining...\\n4. Processor n RAM. I\\'m using the 6+128GB variant, RAM optimisation is brilliant, G90 with Octa Core@ 2.05GHz is doing the job wonderfully well...\\n5. Alexa. For all those Alexa fans, it\\'s a welcome feature at no extra cost...\\n6. MIUI. comes with MIUI Global 10.4.4...which is smooth n user friendly nd I\\'m sure the latest patch will be available soon...\\n7. Budget. @16000/ this is reasonably priced considering the competition in the segment.\\nCons\\n1. Weight. This is a huge phone...n hence it\\'s bulky n after some time Ur hand starts to pain...\\n2. Camera quality. I was a bit disappointed with the camera quality considering it\\'s a quad cam setup with 64 MP as primary..but hey it\\'s okay at this price\\n3. Single hand operation. Found it a lil difficult owing to its size.\\n4. Overall feel. Not very premium, polycarbonate back, looks n feel very cheap.\\nOverall...I would say it\\'s a good budget buy with all those features....Don\\'t go looking for something extraordinary...then u will enjoy it...\\nLastly a word about Amazon delivery...Ordered at 1800h in evening n received at 0800h in the morning through free delivery option, mind boggling...\\nThanks for reading...found it useful...leave a like...\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nsalas\\nWorst experience\\nReviewed in India on 31 December 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nWorst experience.Within one month from purchasing started hanging..Screen goes blank while making a call.Not able to disconnect Call or give a missed call...Forget calling any toll free number..Ads pop up every second...Feels like am not in control of the phone...Some apps start working some pop ups and ads show every time.....Feels like phone is operated by some malicious thing...\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nATUL KAKKAR\\nStopped working in 11 days..... Dissatisfied with Redressal\\nReviewed in India on 29 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe phone\\'s proximity sensor developed a problem in 11 days (10 days is return/replacement window). The proximity sensor got activated the moment a call is made or answered, even without taking the phone to the ear, due to which once the call is connected, I wasn\\'t able to access the screen (Keypad, Add call, Disconnect call, Look for other information.....could do nothing). Had to take it to the service centre, who tried S/W reload, but to no avail. Then they asked me to request Amazon for replacement, which Amazon blatantly refused as it was already the 12th day. As Xiaomi service centre didn\\'t even have spares of this phone yet, they agreed to put it for replacement. I submitted the phone on 14th Nov. and I am still waiting to receive the replacement phone. This is my first Xiaomi phone and I have to say it is a regrettable experience thus far.\\n\\nHowever, on paper the phone looks good and hope the actual performance will also be good. But will be able to comment on that, once I am able to use the phone.\\n\\nXiaomi, if you are listening - PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!!\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nMiss shendre\\nBest phone\\nReviewed in India on 20 January 2020\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nIt\\'s functioning very smoothly and camera is awesome. I purchased Samsung M 30 before 6 months and after lates update in December my camera stoped working. Tried everything but it didn\\'t work and phone got hanged several time.\\nSo I thought to try my luck with Amazon sales exchange offfer and got this 16 k phone with 8 k exchanged value.\\n\\nMost IMP I wasn\\'t sure about exhange as my phone has little scraches but delivery guys just check IMEI no and phone got exchanged. He waited patiently while for 15 min while I transferred my data to laptop. Sign out of all app.\\n\\nIt\\'s my 1st exchanged.

Some of the major pros are:\\n1. Excellent 16 MP Camera.\\n2. Good battery life with decent fast charging.\\n3. Notification LED\\n4. Very fast and snappy with good call quality.\\n\\nThe major cons:\\n1. Audio over 3.5 mm jack is not clean (as compared to honor 8 or realme 2 pro, I am very surprised at this).\\n2. Phone\\'s a bit bulky\\n3. No pre-applied screen guard\\n4. Loudspeaker not \"so loud\".\\n5. Wide angle camera is poor in low light conditions.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nMayank j.\\nHonest and real review\\nReviewed in India on 19 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nI would like to a honest review.\\n\\n1. Build quaility - 4.8/5. Because of too much bump of the camera , so be careful with that or use a good quality back cover for protection\\n\\n2. Camera - 5/5. Depth ,details can be seen very clearly, hdr is good nd because of hdr is available in all the way, wide angle is gud , macro lens is clear but not that much i expected but in this price range it is best, video at 4k overall good.\\n\\n3. Performance - the main and the foremost thing that everyone thinks about the perfomance, nd now this beast comes with Helio G90T which is too much powerful processor for gaming, multitasking , nd power packed work , pubg , cod plays at higher resolution at ease . The best performance and gaming phone in this budget .\\n\\n4- Design - the back glass is with gorilla glass 5 and it luks amazing with 3 different colour i prefer white for attractive luk but for elegant luks u can go for gamma green.\\n\\n5- Battery & charging - it comes 4500 mah battery which works well a day or more , if u are heavy usager so it can give up to 1 day to u nd for normal users it can give more than a day . Charging is gud but 18 w charger seems to be more faster than it is. It takes around 2 hours to charge from 2% to 100% .\\n\\nOverall i think at this price range redmi note 8 pro is the king of all or u can say a beast .....\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nPrivate\\nYouTube Viewing Experience üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé\\nReviewed in India on 19 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nFirst thing after purchasing this item I faced was YouTube Videos not looks great like others Redmi note series phones.. You can\\'t get good feelings when you will see any YouTube videos on 360p or 480p resolution... Second thing I noticed that Native Video Calling support is not good... Native Video call image is very noisy.. I thought after update this issues will be solved but after buying this phone two updates roll out..

NFC chip might be included to store a virtual debit card to cutoff annual issuance charges of physical debit cards. FM is very poor signaled.

But since I have used Redmi for many years, I decided to use same brand.\\n\\nWhen I got the mobile first, I was surprised and very happy that it had option like Slow Motion in Camera, and most importantly, it has dedicated Memory Card slot. Which is generally not available in China models.\\n\\nBut within one week, I started noticing the mobile was slow sometimes, getting hung very often and gets very hot after using just to browse Facebook for 2 hours. Even when charging the mobile gets too hot.\\n\\nIt is a real disappointment. I also checked with couple of other who purchased Redmi 8 and Redmi Note 8 Pro during same time of sale, and all of them have the same problem. So I am not sure if Redmi offered the discount price just to sell of their defective piece. Unfortunately the problems started after 7-10 days and so there is no use of exchange as the exchange period is also over.\\n\\nA real disappointment and waste of money. I would not recommend anyone to buy this mobile. Redmi had my full faith as I have used Redmi mobiles since last 5 years and my wife is using Redmi Note 7. But this time, I should have stuck to my instinct and not got Redmi Note 8 Pro.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nChandrakant\\nValue For Money\\nReviewed in India on 12 February 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nI\\'ve been using this for months now, and am quite impressed. Battery life is great, sometimes lasting 3 days of light use. Gaming capability seems decent as well, easily beating any of my previous phones. It took a while to get used to MIUI, but it\\'s fine now. I like that it comes with a silicone cover too. The phone is slightly larger than I\\'d like, but easily worth the trade off.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nS B\\nWorst phone by Xiaomi since 2014\\nReviewed in India on 26 February 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nWorst phone by Xiaomi since 2014. Reason are as follows -\\n1. Camera quality is very bad. Macro lens i\\nhave useless clarity.\\n2. I has 3A charger with Quick Charge. But it takes more than 25% more time to charge, in comparison to original Mi 2A charger.\\n3. Most worst feature of Redmi Note 8 pro us its GPS. It is not recording or displaying correct route, although GPS signal is full. Mi fit is showing strange path in form of straight lines. Other phones are working fine within same locality. Writing to Xiaomi at service.in@xiaomi.com got no solution.\\n4. Phone lags due to poor Helio processor.\\n5. Bluetooth have severe problem. It is not working with various bluetooth earphones like Infinity Glide 100, Sony 200 etc. On call, it sends voice exactly after 15 seconds. I returned Infinity glide 100 earphone thinking that earphone is faulty but same earphone is working in other phones.\\nService center is unable to rectify these problems.\\nI request Amazon to post this without any alteration so that other customers may be benefited by not purchasing Redmi Note 8 Pro phone.\\nAmazon and its seller did their best. I will give 5 star to Amazon and its seller but 1 star to Xiaomi.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nsunil sethi\\nProduct Is Good\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nXiaomi\\'s Redmi Note 8 Pro Is The Upgraded version of Note 7 Pro..\\n..now I\\'m Talking about this Phone..\\n1 HelioG90T Processor Is Good For Gaming\\n2 Battery Backup Is Good But Heating Issue\\n3 Camera Is Not As We Expected, XT can beat easily..so it will be slove by Software update\\n4 Sound Is Good But Not Loud ,\\n5 redmi Note 8 Pro is look Like A Premium Smartphone, Protected By Corning Gorilla Glass 5\\nNow It\\'s Time For Rating\\nCamera 7/10\\nDisplay 9/10\\nBattery 9/10\\nPerformance 9/10\\nSoftware 8/10\\n3 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAnup Balkawade\\nBelow Average Product\\nReviewed in India on 10 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nDissapointing From MI, Very Poor Network Connectivity, Proximety Sensor Issue, Microphone and Speaker Issue,Both Camera is not up to the mark only a market strategy..Replacement awaited.\\n6 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nRohit M.\\nawesome picture quality\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe g90 t processor is super gives an average of 50 fps during pubg gameplay and continues 60fps throughout the whole gameplay of cod i am using it for a week now... the camera quality is overall good not that high end like one plus but at this price range it is good the 64 mp camera needs an ui upgrade because it is incapable of getting focus the image is blurry...... the fhd+ screen is no less than those amoled screen i found no difference between those two if you use a good temper glass you found no difference\\n4 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nveenesh upadhyay\\nGjb\\nReviewed in India on 5 March 2020\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nNice looks mobail... nice.... battery backup poor... display average... ddr kush huaa\\n6 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Till 25th June it was working fine. From 26th June it just doesn\\'t start. I tried it multiple times, pressed the start button for 15-20sec, charged the phone, it shows it is charging, but everything failed. When i called MI customer care, they said i ll have to visit the service centre and there is no other way out.... But currently due to covid, the service centres in my area in Mumbai are all shut and hence this phone is just lying dead in my cupboard.... This is a very sad thing as my money is stuck....i can\\'t buy a new phone, or get it replaced as the window has passed or even get it to the service centre. Overall a very bad experience as u would not want a phone to be dead within one month of u purchasing it. Tried speaking to Amazon customer care multiple times but because of email id not being linked from their end.... They say they can\\'t help me and i need to call customer care again to manually get it linked....i emailed them the screenshot of linking and verifying my email id...

But this time it disappointed me a lot because of very poor audio quality and the issue with the grip of the phone. Camera quality could have been better although its a 64 mega pixel but quality id very bad. I think Xioami needs to rethink on their strategy of quickly producing various models just to be in the market. Rather they should focus on stability in the market by providing quality product by taking good time to design, develop and market.\\n\\nI am not liking at all writing such feedback for Redmi phone but quite disappointed this time.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nSiva Sankar P G\\nWorst Camera, and Worst Software Experience.\\nReviewed in India on 27 February 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nCamera is the worst, the Quad setup is as gimmicky as it can. Try taking a shot with Zoom, even 2X Zoom the image will get distorted so much you don\\'t even want to look at it, if you go beyond that it gets all blurry. I tried taking pic of slides from a distance of less than 5 meters and the image quality is utter rubbish.\\nThe attached pic is taken from within 2 meters distance and with no zoom. And you can see the lack of clarity.\\n\\nSoftware is really buggy, auto rotate option sucks, you have to keep the rotate off all the times otherwise you\\'ll have lot of problems with apps as they open in landscape mode even when you are holding up right.\\n\\nAfter using a month, I really feel it doesn\\'t worth the money or hype.\\n\\nBattery performance is the only saving grace for this phone.\\n\\nAnd by the way no proper security updates as well.\\n\\nIn the rush to make too many phones, the company is forgetting the basic fulfillments to satisfy the already existing customer base.\\n\\nUpdate after 3 months:\\n\\nReceived Android 10 update : The auto rotate issues has been fixed.\\n\\nHowever, the update came up with more bugs.\\n\\n1. While browsing websites, you can\\'t accept popups as the screen will be irresponsive.\\n2. Screen becomes suddenly irresponsive while using various apps.\\n3.

Battery:- 4/5\\n2. Display:- 3/5\\n3. Processor:- 4.5/5\\n4. Camera:- 4.5/5\\n5. Build and design:- 4/5\\n\\n:=> Detailed Review ‚úì‚úì‚úì\\n1. Battery:- Uses a 4500W battery but I think the MIUI is not much optimised for the better battery life . The Drainage is really quick even without gaming. Though you get a 18W fast charger but still takes a good amount of time to charge .\\n\\n2. Display:- Its a Full HD screen also the display is sharp. But what disappointed me was it\\'s standard 60hz refresh rate , Which at this price point is a necessity. The good thing is you get HDR support for YouTube.\\n\\n3. Processor:- The Mediatek Helio G90T is a beast for Gaming you can play Smooth + Extreme , and still this a good processor at this price point . The bad side is it starts to heat after continues gaming and also a little bit warm when using the phone for daily tasks.\\n\\n4. Camera:- The 64 Megapixel is good the macro camera works perfect. You have 1080p@60fps video recording also 4k@30fps supported. The slow Mo is @960fps is also quite impressive. But overall a good camera phone but not the best.\\n\\n5. Build and design:- The design looks glossy and good finished. The water drop notch looks a bit old but can be used. Has a shiny and pretty glass back which makes it vulnerable to scratches I hope you use a back cover. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, but would be better if it was on the power button or on screen. The thing which makes it less abstract is it\\'s weight and with the back cover on it feels pretty heavy.\\n\\nFinal Verdict :- The redmi note 8 pro is a good value for money phone out there and if you are interested you should buy it. But it has some better alternative which would be worth using.\\n\\nNo Problems with Packing.

For playing PUBG this phone is remarkable not facing any lags, well i play with smooth/Extreme graphics settings. This is built for gamers and we cant find a phone under 20k price range for best gaming, G90T is built for gaming. No issues in day to day usage as i installed a lot of Apps and still running smoothly. I went for a 6/64 variant as i have a memory card of 128 gb. Thanks to that extra slot. Display is quite good in this price range comparing with realme 6, good brightness level and HDR10 supported. Build quality is premium, nice and handly, looks premium, just dissappointed with fingerprint sensor built parallel to camera. Ram management is quite good. Go for it guys if you are an insane gamer and looking a phone under 20k price range. Little bit heating üî• issue is there but not crossed 41 in room temperature while playing PUBG in extreme graphics which i prefer, but we wont find any lag.charging time is about 2 hours from 15 to 100 percent.and 100 to 30 percent for 5 to 6 games of pubg thats approx 2 hrs or more. .speaker quality is normal. Give likes if u find this usefull.

I read other reviews saying it\\'s good for pubg. Yes, if there is no one near you or if you play tdm, it\\'s fine. In classic, getting a single kill in close range combats is a miracle. It doesn\\'t matter which guns are at play. Even if you have groza and if your opponent has a pistol, you would lose. Frames get dropped a lot to the point where you can\\'t really see what is going on. Aiming is not possible at all. Mid range and long range fights are fine. You can\\'t rush enemies with this phone. For a phone advertised as having a processor optimized for gaming, its really not worth its salt. PS: my review is based on the following graphics settings: Smooth and Medium frame rate, no anti-aliasing.\\n\\nApart from that, the battery life is good. Camera is decent for this price range.\\n\\nVerdict: Helio G90T fails to deliver.\\n\\nEdit: I realised that the red shade of screen is not a feature but a bug. Apparently there is no fix for that. Basically if you have some money to waste, go for this mobile, as there will be no resale value with major problems like these.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nVery good\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nVery good\\n7 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nBubble observed\\nReviewed in India on 7 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nProduct need replacement\\n7 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazonE\\nfriensds Read my review before by ones.. after using 17 days ..i would like to say ..\\nReviewed in India on 21 January 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nfriends Read my review before by ones..\\nafter using 17 days ..i would like to say ..if you are thinking To by this phone for processors then go for it...i am giving 3-star just for running smoothly..but if you thinking to by for Quad camera then its Bad decission like me...( No detailing in long distance subject in Image..if you go for more than 4x zoom image quality Die..slow motion video not support to take long time..as well micron lense not professional ..)\\npresently i am not happy with camera..

Great looks and value.\\nReviewed in India on 24 January 2020\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nA beautiful phone. Halo White looks exquisite.\\nI was torn between Samsung M30 S which was cheaper for Great Indian sale and Realme X2 on Flipkart. But Redmi note 8 pro had more good reviews. Got 10 % discount with credit card for 6gb ram / 128 gb storage. Samsung has a plastic body vs. Redmi\\'s gorilla glass front and back which looks premium, which was a deciding factor for me.\\nCamera also is better than Samsung. Has a good battery and 18 w fast charger. Display is vibrant. Touch and finger print scanner is quick without lags.\\n\\nFinger print scanner is right below the camera lens on the back so your finger smudges lens if you are not used to it, if you have used front finger print scanner.\\nNot a big fan of MiUI coming from pure Android. Disabled all ads and bloatware before first use. MiUI has dark mode which is good.\\nThis is a powerful phone performance wise.\\nOnly complaint is the ringtone volume is not very loud.\\nPhone is a bit heavy but the battery is of higher capacity.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nShah\\nNot much as I expected!\\nReviewed in India on 18 December 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nI\\'ve got this phone two weeks back and have been using it for the past ten days.\\n\\nFingerprint reader - fast, accurate and good!\\n\\nScreen size- neither too big, nor too small! Just as what we want\\n\\nDisplay clarity - you may think that this phone lacks amoled display, but trust me! Even though using IPS LCD, its way better! But yea, you may find the screen brightness not too bright or sufficient enough..\\n\\nCamera quality - this is what I wanted to say about, I don\\'t know whether it\\'s just my phone fault or some kind of issue, whenever I click pictures, it definitely has some distortions or some noise! I\\'ve took a lot of photos but still I don\\'t feel it as 64 mp cam phone! This is where I want to go for realme XT!\\n\\nBattery life - I was using redmi note 7 pro(4000 mah) before this one, and I seriously don\\'t feel any difference between these two despite this 8 pro having a 4500 mah battery!\\n\\nQuick charge - yea just as the name depicts, it\\'s quick! But not fast enough as you want\\n\\nPerformance - having helio G90T as it\\'s core chipset, it performs well.. but there\\'s still a second lag, when you clear your memory and return to home screen! You can go on gaming without any worry, but phone may heat up slightly when you go on gaming for more than 40 mins!\\n\\nThese issues that I have found may be because of miui 10, where miui 11 has some improvements in system! But I won\\'t lie about the camera quality which is not so good as a 64 mp cam!\\n\\nAsk me if you have any doubts!\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nimran vohra\\nDil thod diya redmi walo ne\\nReviewed in India on 13 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nDon\\'t buy this redmi note 8 Pro\\nBohot hi jayda Bakwas camera hai\\n7 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\ngaurav waila\\nAwesome phone .

The network on this phone ranges from decent to lousy. On my old Nokia 6.1 Plus, I used to get 4G network in sections of Mumbai that this phone just doesn\\'t manage. Call drops and random silences are another thing. I already got a replacement for this reason alone but the newer phone is no improvement. I narrowly missed the replacement deadline being out of station on work. Then there are irritations like the message tones not changing to what you set ... So no matter what you set, only the default one rings. Yes, Bluetooth plays in LDAC which is nice but the ear piece volume is so low that I have to use the handsfree all the time. Not something that I had a problem with on the Nokia. In fact, my other choice was the Nokia 7.2 and I should have gone for that. Android One and Nokia are indeed a good combination and this glitchy phone reaffirms that.\\nPs: the auto brightness also doesn\\'t work properly ...

I have put a 64 GB card thereby getting a capacity of 6/128 @12400+550= 12950/- ....\\nCons:\\nSelfie camera is good but all other cameras are satisfactory only\\nIt takes crispy images but not with sharp details rather does some make up kind of job.\\nNight mode makes pic like painting not clear.\\nThose who are in the fancy of 64 mega pixels should rethink...a camera with lesser mega pixel can do wonder ... this race of mega pixel is useless.\\n\\nA little bit heavier than usual... because it flaunts gorilla glass front and back...but this makes it sexy too.\\n\\nOverall I got 6/64 @12400 ... this is almost a look a like of one+.....

It\\'s been months and I love it.\\n\\nI switched over from Apple which was huge for me. There are quite a few differences.\\n\\nYou can\\'t get your apple backup onto an Android phone. So I lost my whatsApp data. But I shifted my contacts to my SIM so was able to get at least that. Other than that, I started from scratch, downloading my apps and signing in to all of them.\\n\\nBut I absolutely love the phone.\\n\\nBattery lasts a day and a half.\\nDropped it a couple of times, but I have a case and tempered glass. It\\'s all still intact.\\nHuge amount of storage.\\nGreat camera.\\nWorks fast. No lags.\\nGreat features to share images and videos directly to a wide range of apps.\\n\\nMy only issues are minor:\\n\\nWhatsApp video camera quality is weird. Very poor.\\nCan\\'t save single videos on whatsapp. Have to turn on save to gallery for all media.\\n\\nIt\\'s really an amazing phone and it\\'s so cheap for what it has to offer.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nSourav Das\\nAbsolutely Worth It\\nReviewed in India on 26 May 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nEverything is great as expected from this phone except for the ads that are shown up in these redmi smartphones and few bloatwares, if you are ready to compromise with ads and pre-installed useless applications, then go ahead and make the purchase cause this is the most value for money product. I have a friend who have Redmi K20 Pro, he suddenly came up to me so that he can show off to me his overpriced smartphone and this Redmi note 8 pro beat his one with a great distance, he tried to show off from his camera and Note 8 Pro\\'s camera quality knocked him off and he was like, I paid so much money for this premium device and it got beaten up by this midrange smartphone what a fool I was to spend such amount of money on K20 Pro.

And this feature is also not available on \"Redmi Note 8\" phone which recently got MIUI 11 Update so please bring it in that phone also in upcoming updates.\\nThank You with Hope to get it soon.\\nNo finger print shelter no star.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nMishal Mohammed\\nPerformance Beast For The Price\\nReviewed in India on 26 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe variant I bought was the 128GB storage with 6GB RAM in the Gamma Green colour.\\n\\nDesign & Build: The colour and design of the back feels premium with Gorilla Glass 5 protection. The curved edge makes it comfortable to hold the phone even though it weighs more than an average phone. The weight distribution is done well.\\n\\nDisplay: The IPS LCD panel is excellent and feels premium. Measuring at 6.53\", it is definitely big but you\\'ll get used to it. Or not.\\n\\nPerformance: The new processor has silenced the critics with impeccable performance. I haven\\'t noticed any stutters or glitches. Multitasking runs smoothly with good RAM management.\\n\\nBattery: 4500 mAh battery is a monster. I easily got 11-12 hrs of screen-on time with 30 mins of gaming. If you\\'re a casual user, it could easily last two days on a single charge. The included 18W charger is an added bonus.\\n\\nCamera: The quad camera is good at the price range but nothing extraordinary. Low light photos are noisy and could be corrected with Gcam or future updates.\\n\\nCons: 1) At 6.53\", forget about one handed use. So if size is a big deal for you, this isn\\'t the best choice.\\n2) MIUI and its ads. Fortunately you can turn off most of it and delete the bloatware.\\n3) Camera isn\\'t professional grade by any means. 64 MP is fine and all, but that should not be the deciding factor.\\n\\nVerdict: At this price point, I would definitely RECOMMEND this as it is a good all round phone. Performance wise, this is a BEAST. Gamma Green and Halo White are the best colours of the pack.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nVaibhav Thakkar\\nPathetic Chinese product, 6 months usage, read before buying!\\nReviewed in India on 4 June 2020\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nCons:\\n1.

Stunning in looks. Awesome in performance. Unmatched in Price\\nReviewed in India on 29 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe Redmi Note 8 Pro surprised me. The delivery was pretty fast. Got it the very next day by 11 a.m. After unboxing, the phone had about 59% power and it lasted the whole day. The phone is extremely elegant in looks and feel. We selected the gamma green and its envying. The phone is just one day old and is being used by my wife. The UI is very smooth ( but the in-built ads can be annoying sometimes). The navigation is very smooth. I did play one game for a long time and did not find any lag or heating up issues. The camera is out of this world. Alexa is mind-blowing. FM Radio is equally good. The sound output is real. The video clarity is remarkable. It has separate dual nano sim slots and a dedicated slot for a memory card or expandable GBs. The silicon carry case is also of good quality. I shall review this phone in detail at a later stage.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\njovian\\nRedmi note 8 pro 6/128gb Review.\\nReviewed in India on 3 January 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nLoved the phone.\\n\\nRedmi did an awesome job with this phone.\\nTho at first the camara was noise and dull but after updating it to miui 11 it is really awesome i cant stop taking pics from the 64mp.\\nNow about the performance, i would say it gives you the feeling as tho you are playing on a premium phone i played it for 6 hours straight on HDR+ with high refresh rate. The phone can handle itself well i did not face any lag of frame drops. There was heating but if you play on max setting of any phone for long hours you will face heating. The battery was amazing it lasted for 8 hrs (6hrs of high setting which left it at 5 percentage and the 2 hours of mild usage) i wiuld say the prosessor has to do a lot with powersaving as it ment for performance and saving. The wide angle camare still needs work mainly at low light image does come dark but ofcourse that some you will only notice if you do a comparison.\\nHaptic has modes high is the best you feel life something is ticking you in the pocket when you are riding or driving. The audio was a high inprovement after the update now i can hear it from the other room. :) There are cons like if you are swiping very fast if will detect a tocuh anywhere on the screen also when i placed my earphones on it the phone went crazy ( sadly it managed to uninstall Pubg and all i could do was watch as all my data went down the drain) but that fine i installed it again.\\nThe call quality ti good i can hear what people are saying and people can hear what i am saying so no problem there. Internet speed now that really depends on how far the tower is fron you, you will face really slow speeds. my airtel is the worst\\nWith speed from very good to worst.\\n1) jio/vodaphone. Both sims have 4g active at once. So you you turn on inter on one the other won\\'t goto 3g.\\n2) idea tho it\\'s part of voda now but not as good as voda\\n3) airtel.\\nThe download speeds for jio are at 2 mb/s that what i got when i was downloading from plastore speedtest showed 10mb/s i did get 10 mb/s but after 3 to 6 am when network traffic is reduced. With voda i got 800 kb/s to 2mb/s it staded at 2mb for the most part but there were drops way more the jio.\\nIdeo had 600kb/s to 1mb/s that was the best i got from it.\\nNow it\\'s airtel with 160 kb/s to 400kb/s\\nI was able to download buy hugh files i was just sitting and watching thr screen.\\nYou have to keep in mind this is in my area it may be defferent in your area.\\n\\nI hope this helps i will try to update of any changes.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nGuru\\nA very decent phone with excellent features.

Camera App is good, Battery backup good too. Fast Charger is working great. Specifically liked the Calender App with integrated Panchang and other stuffs. Not sure if that Calender app is available in other Android Mobiles and iPhones.\\n\\nFound one serious issue after the latest update to MIUI 11 where Incoming SMS causes the audio to disappear, for a while, during an ongoing call.

Killer Cameras.\\nReviewed in India on 2 March 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nProbably the best phone under 15k or even 20k, it wouldn\\'t be an exaggeration to say that. Yes, it lacks a few things like an AMOLED display, Inbuilt fingerprint Scanner which it\\'s competitors offer, but still this phone beats them when it comes to overall performance, the Mediatek Helio G90T processor is no joke, this thing scored 28-29k on Antutu benchmark, way ahead than the phones offered on even greater budgets. I don\\'t play games, but the overall performance is very fluidic when heavily multitasked. The camera is another plus point, day light shots are phenomenal, low light shots are good, but the tables turn when you install GCAM! Yes, the phone now supports GCAM fully right out of the box. You just need to install it along with a proper configuration file. That\\'s it, go for this your eyes closed. I\\'m a neophyte when it comes to clicking pictures, but you can do better. So, attaching a few shots, shot with GCAM astrophotography mode.\\nEdit: Love this phone even more, learnt to click pictures in pro mode, and surprisingly I think they are even better than GCAM low light shots; I have added a few more pictures for you to see.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

I was particularly happy with the camera quality. Although the 64MP option is not really useful (as it just eats up all of the disc space), it is really cool to have that feature and the photos taken in the 64MP feature turned on is sharp and crisp and encorporate a lot more details.\\nThe Helio G90T processor is really fast and responsive and works pretty well for gaming and for ordinary day-to-day tasks as well, although it being a 13nm process doesn\\'t really help with the battery life. It lasted me hardly a day and I can\\'t quite complain, considering the fact that I use the phone a lot and do a lot of heavy gaming like PUBG Mobile (the game runs on high graphic settings by default) but if you are a normal user who uses the phone for day-to-day tasks, it would probably last you a day and a half or more. The 18W fast charger provided with the phone charges it pretty quickly considering the 4500 mah battery of the Redmi Note 8 Pro.\\nAlthough it has an IPS LCD screen, it\\'s one of the best screens so far with as deep blacks as an AMOLED screen.\\nAll in all, it\\'s an all-rounder of a phone and if you are looking for one that is in the sub-15000 Rs range, then this is definitely a phone that you should check out.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nDeepak\\nI love the quality and camera\\nReviewed in India on 16 February 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nI would say that this is the best phone available in this price range. Super built with amazing functions and speed is way more than what you require. Camera quality is something which I didn\\'t find as per the specifications but it\\'s better than others. Good quality pictures can be clicked even at low light. I must say, good phone with reliability and functionality.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nVishu\\nMalfunctioning screen\\nReviewed in India on 17 June 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nGot the device yesterday evening. Checked it out today and found that the screen has a very Erratic response to touches. The minimise button locks the phone so no multi apps at a time. The display kind of resets and reaches to home and the work being done in an app is lost.You need to start all the work again. I had to take another phone to write the whole review as this phone kept on refreshing/resetting on its own. Seems, I am unfortunate to get a malfunctioning device.\\nAmazon technical support yielded no response.\\nAwaiting action from amazon team\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nGood phone with bad night camera- edit: and worst network reception\\nReviewed in India on 30 January 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe phone is good considering the price point.\\n\\nThinks I liked about phone are;\\n1. The display quality is very good considering the IPS panel installed on it. It gives good competition to AMOLED.\\n2. The Build quality is premium and I liked it so much. While colour looks good.\\n3. The camera performance in day light condition is very good.\\n4. Audio output is good.\\n5. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is very fast and accurate.\\n6. Have done some gaming and performance is very good. Haven\\'t experience much heating issue. Phone gets little warm at the back specially near camera setup but cools down quickly. The outside temperature plays big roll here.\\n7. Touch response and overall RAM management is good.\\n\\nThinks I didn\\'t like;\\n1. The camera performance at night is terrible, as photos captured have lot of noise. Need fix for it from Xiaomi.\\n2. Most of the pre-installed apps can not be disabled.\\n3. The MI apps and priorities given to these apps. e.g. there was a gesture which will open google search if swipe up is done anywhere on screen. However, after recent updates, it was changed from Google search to MI browser.\\n\\nOverall this is a good buy at this price point and you will not be disappointed at all. .\\n\\nEdit: I have been using this device for almost 5 months now. I found one major and most important problem with this. That is network reception and stability. I am currently in low network area. When I saw mobile from brands like Realme, Micromax can provide good signal quality and 4G reception, MI devices suck. I am getting poor 4G network with this. Also, after 11.0.4.0 update on MIUI, if you got any call and network changed to 2G, to change it to 4G, I have to restart it again. Before 11.0.4.0 OTA update, airplane mode used to work. Pissed off with this device.. No exchange offers as well to change it and buy new device.. Please consider this fact before buying MI device, specially if you live in low network area. Go for other brands..\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nShukant Sharma\\nOUTPERFORMER FOR THE PRICE-A MUST BUY-A TECH LOVERS REVIEW\\nReviewed in India on 14 March 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nA user review after using it for 15daysüìÖ I just love checking out new technology.

Chin is negligible for the price(buy a green or blue version for a seamless experience\\nHDR SUPPORT-üëÅÔ∏èfor the videos in yt and other platforms for the price is amazing\\nALEXA-inbuilt is one of the mind blowing features of 8pro missing in all other phones. üåà‚òî‚ùÑÔ∏èüåçüìΩÔ∏èüìåüìëü§π use it and be smart if not\\nWEIGHT-üí™ its on the heavier side, I like light small phones(this one is a gift) üòÇüòÇüì±not a deal breaker\\nVERDICT - If you don\\'t want to spend(waste) your money on expensive phones and buy some needful stuff for you with the money you save.. You should absolutely go for this beast and beauty. Redmi is doing justice to its consumer with such competitive phones.. This phone easily competes with the price range of 20K phones. All in all a must buy for under 15K buyers, don\\'t go anywhere else. Note 9pro is a gimmic, with nothing much inside.

Its a great device and is still working fine till date. That is the reason why I have chosen to stay with the brand for even more years to come.\\n\\nAfter doing some comparisons, I\\'ve decided to go with Redmi Note 8 Pro. Its been three days and it\\'s working really good.\\n\\nI will give a detailed review of the phone after one month of usage.\\n\\nNote: The first delivered device had a quality issue. I\\'ve examined a light bleed on the LCD panel near the power button area, approximately 5mm from the edge of the screen. I didn\\'t knew how that defect happened. Didn\\'t observe it on the first day. There was no visible damage on the glass as well. I immediately ordered for a replacement and recieved it in good condition.

Camera quality outside is excellent but not in low light conditions. Battery is as usual decent. Display quality is also satisfied. Finger print sensor having no complaints. Face lock also very good. Playing PubG is not an excellent experience but not bad though. I suggest all Redmi products when their model becomes old coz in new model there is not much difference but Redmi reducess it\\'s old old prices on a big scale. You can\\'t match any other price with that after reducing prices.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nRedmi gives you more in this budget .\\nReviewed in India on 8 November 2019\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nThe phone is great with this budget .No loopholes rear camera is good and processor is great , you will love playing game .clarity is more in both the camera .overall great phone .Avail the airtel offer ,it will add cherry for data .\\nDisplay is IPS + HDR not amoled but picture quality is good and bright gives astonishing display .I converted from samsung to xiaomi first time and i feel pretty good .Good step if anybody is upgrading .\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

But review option wasn\\'t allowed then. So writting now almost after 2 weeks of usage, Mobile is so so. Camera is just above ok. Mobile seems heavy while you are watching movies or playing games. Mobile doesn\\'t look premium, built quality is like plastic made. Note 7 pro is still the best mobile in Redmi series.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nPuti imsong\\nMy take on the Note 8 pro\\nReviewed in India on 5 February 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nLet me highlight the pros and cons\\n\\nPros.\\n\\n1. Fingerprint detection is lightning fast.\\n\\n2. Battery life is absolutely great.\\n\\n3. Miui 11 is much better than their past UI.\\n\\n4. Build quality is top notch.\\n\\n5. You can use two sims plus 1 microsd separately.\\n\\n6. At first i was sceptical about mediatek as in the past i encountered a lot of lagging and hanging problems but this Processor the Speed and performance is the best i have ever used on a budget phone it feels like using the Snapdragon 800 series with no problems. Great job Xiaomi.\\n\\n7. I lost my led light controller but thanks to the infrared on this phone i can control my lights now also TV and stuff. It\\'s a neat feature.\\n\\nCons.\\n\\n1. If your buying this mobile for photography. DONT BUY PLEASE. under natural light photos look good but under unnatural lights it looks really bad. Now some might say camera is superb but i guess this is the only phone they have ever used with a camera of this category of smartphones. Trust me the nokia 7.1 though old its camera is much much better. Also the macro lens is pathetic and the selfie too. Megapixels don\\'t make photos good. The image processing software does so Xiaomi is still way far behind.\\n\\n2. Wifi speed does not exceed 1.2Mbps for some reason. And i did a quick Google search many people have same issue.\\n\\n3. Phone feels a little too big though it is really nice for watching videos and reading.\\n\\n4. I have used better display than this note 8 pro in its category. My issue is with the pixels when your typing your phone you can see the small diodes. Though i believe it\\'s because i have used better phones and it\\'s a distraction only for me and that i am Focusing too much on it.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf your a person like me who wants to play games and use whatsapp insta and such and click pictures on the go and don\\'t care much about it, big battery, good display, performance like a beast go for this phone instead of a flagship phone and rather save the money and buy an ipad mini in the future.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nSayan Patel\\nsuperfast gaming/multitasking device\\nReviewed in India on 23 May 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nPROS:\\n*massive screen with a teardrop notch- doesn\\'t hinder with content viewing/gaming\\n*HDR 1080p display. (Supports HDR content which looks awesome)\\n*amazing set of cameras.\\n*camera to api out of the box\\n*gaming mediatek processor is a blaze. Was a snapdragon fanboy till this device arrived.\\n*USB type c for charging and data transfer.\\n*18w fast charging. which is definitely a speedy charge for those who haven\\'t experienced it before.\\n*Fingerprint reader is blazing fast, so is face unlock.\\n\\nCONS:\\n*low light camera performance not that great (Here, camera to api helps)\\n*18w fast charging though is good, they could have provided a faster charger.\\n*speakers don\\'t have punch\\n*face unlock is not as secure as a 3d scanning present in other devices, but its acceptable.\\n*updates seems to be late.\\n\\nMy view towards this product is that it is a bang for your buck. Handles games like butter and has no heating issues till now. Every phone heats up so does this but not anything alarming. 3 hours of pubg in hdr ultra is a breeze. The cameras are awesome and provides a huge variety of lenses for your every needs. Screen is awesome with gorilla glass 5 protection on front and back, havent used a tempered glass yet and has no scratches till now.\\nAwesome product, I recommend this product to all.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nAverage phone in this range\\nReviewed in India on 18 January 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nFingerprint reader is small, camera not that great, battery charging takes 2 hrs.

After a week\\'s time, my experience is good except for the battery performance and fingerprint sensor position. A battery of new phone having just one day life after full charge is something unexpected keeping in view I am a moderate user and dont play pubg or games.Secondly, position of fingerprint sensor is prehistoric. How can designer make such mistake by aligning camera and fingerprint sensor in one single line and that too at the back of the phone.This bad alignment ignites chances of contamination of lenses while one tries to unlock phone using finger and yeah not to forget our fingers are often dirty, aren\\'t they üòú.\\nWell now comes camera which is fabulous. 64 megapixel does wonders exactly the way manufacturer describes.Also, phone dimensions are little exaggerated but one can always use \"One-handed operation\" feature and you will start loving the length and breadth of it instantly.\\nOverall a nice budget phone and worth buy !!\\nLet me know if you would like to hear about any other feature.

The phone is snappy and I did not find any issue in general usage.\\nUI : the best and worst UI. Most user friendly UI ever made is married with unnecessary Ads.\\nGaming : Gaming is smooth on the phone and did not find any issue\\nFingerprint scanner : placed at a very odd position. Finger smudges the camera often.\\nCamera: The most dissapointing feature (also the reason I bought the phone ) is the camera. The front cam is Great but the back camera is pathetic. In the same price range Realme/ViVo provide much much better cameras. Night mode is a gimmick and distorts the image completely.

I have been using Redmi Note 3 for last three years. Such a wonderful phone. However, due to lack of space and low time of battery I thought to go for a new phone and this Redmi Note 8 pro has come freshly so I blindly jumped to this. I ordered and got it on 31st December; a very fast delivery by Amazon. However, when I started operating the phone its sound and basic settings are just like Note 3 with very minor improvement. The most disappointing part is its touch of key boards. Most of the time the touch of the letter keys does not type what you intend to and also very often touch of space key does not create space between words. So is the shift of key pad from alphabet to numbers also does not respond quickly. There is also a problem such as when you are watching a video and suddenly you have to move to some other work on the phone then navigating keys do not appear on the screen and then you have to switch off the phone sometimes. It is non-satisfactory phone. I dont know whether it is due to I bought online or due to some software issue, it needs to be checked. But I am dissatisfied with this piece.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nAmazon Customer\\nSuper\\nReviewed in India on 7 November 2019\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nI brought this on first day sell.

Night mode is very good and 64 mp images are also very good. Front camera is also good.\\n\\nMiui 11 is very smooth and UI is very good.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s very good phone and worthy.

Not at all happy with this product which I bought.\\n1. Product ordered on 10 June & Delivered on 13 June.\\n2. I started using the phone from 14 June. It worked fine until 30 June.\\n3. On 1 July morning, phone was functioning fine until 8:50 am. When checked at around 15 minutes later, it suddenly did not just switch on.\\n3. I raised request for service on 1 July itself with Mi Service Center. I was addressed after around an hour of diagnostics that the mother board of the device is not working and that it needs to be changed. It was just 15 days that I started using this device. Mother board was not in stock with them and hence I waited for a week more.\\n4. I again raised the complaint with other service center of Mi on 11 July. I got the phone back on 18 July. I inserted my sim card into it, and set the password and fingerprint in security settings. Phone left idle for about 5 mins.\\n5. After 5 minutes when I tried to unlock the screen, it just didn\\'t although the password entered was correct. I also tried unlocking by finger print and it still did not get unlocked.\\n6. I am continuously trying with other passwords too for unlocking but device is just consistently nit accepting it.\\nEven if the password would have been really incorrect, it should have got locked after 5 unsuccessful trials, but it doesn\\'t. I have tried too many time to unlock but no use.\\n\\nThis item is defective and it only worked fine until initial 15 days. Even after servicing if it shows such issues, I don\\'t trust this device. I am already facing problems due to unavailability of mobile phone with me.\\nPlease replace this device, the item is defective and it is not worth making consistent visits to the service centers.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Powerful processor. You can play high graphics game without lagging.\\n2. Display is pretty good ( as they mentioned that they provide HDR FHD+ Display). I have compared this with redmi note 7s (which is FHD+). Color reproduction is Better compared to redmi note 7s.\\n3. Battery life is also good. It last for 1.5 day by normal using.\\n4. Performance of back camera is good in day light condition. it takes pretty good pics both 64mp and normal camera.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. In low light condition both the cameras back and front takes noise pictures.\\n2. Sometimes Selfie camera survives to detect the depth of the picture. The pictures looks noisy. (Waiting for the new update, by which they may resolve this issue.)\\n2. Video quality is not good in 1080p 30 fps. This problem can be resolved by using the higher mode (1080p 60fps or 4k) of the camera. ( You can not using these mode all the time as it needs more storage).\\n3. When playing high graphics game then the battery becomes very hot. (But the plus point is, it has liquid cooling system which helps to reduce the heat rapidly.)\\n# If you are a gamer then it can disappoint you. While playing high graphic games the battery drains rapidly.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nPraveen kumar\\nGreat and this price\\nReviewed in India on 29 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nReviewing exactly after month of use\\nFingerprint is lighting fast and if placement could be differentiated from camera bump would have been better.\\nCamera is good but gives too much artificial colour during lighting conditions.\\nSlow motion video 120,240,960ps but 960 is limited to 10sec only.\\nGaming this is best of all for this phone if ur gamer the best midrange to go on.games could played upto hdr at high frame rates.\\nBattery would come upto a day at moderate usage and 2 if light usage playing games at high setting drain battery.

Doesn\\'t have the camera quality like realme XT\\nBest for gaming Mediatech Helio processor just fantastic. Even though having a Liquid cooling system it have a bit heating issue but not overheating but compared to Pocco F1 it\\'s a bit hot I\\'m a YouTube content creator. So i use all this phone. If having a bit more budget will suggest to go for Redmi K20 pro Realme X2. Or if looking for a gaming phone go for Asus Rog phone 2. Best tuung is that we are having a Hand free Alexa It\\'s so nice that we can access Alexa by saying \"Alexa\" and Als use Google Assistant at the same time which is not available for any other phone of this range. The only Thing A back draw is its display and the water notch display. It\\'s so tempting that it\\'s just having a led IPS Display. By the way anything can\\'t be perfect. Not that good as Pocco F1 if anyone using Pocco F1 better don\\'t change it. Never go for phone saying 64 MP 108 MP etc because not just Megapixel which matter the picture quality. It has a great photo precision. If it found helpful please follow me and Click of the \"helpful\".\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nRabin Ghosh\\nScreen sensitivity isn\\'t what it should be\\nReviewed in India on 18 December 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nIt\\'s been a few weeks I am using the product and while I am reasonably satisfied with camera quality and processor speed, there are a few areas which could see improvement. Screen sensitivity is one such thing. I am getting more typing errors than before and many a times, particularly while playing a media file, the screen just become insensitive (i have to repeatedly tap to bring it to life). Many useful features like long or customisable screenshot are not there.\\n2 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

I contacted service centre on 25.05.20 for repair under warrant. I was told that there was moisture ingress and total expenditure will be approx Rs+9000 nine thousand and this is not covered in warranty.

Also has a game turbo mode that allows you to perform additional functions while playing the game.\\nFast charging by Type C charger : I generally keep my mobile between 20-80 % . hence it takes roughly 45 - 50 mins to charge within this range.\\n64 GB storage : This humongous amount of storage allows installing any apps, videos, images without constantly working on removing unnecessary data. However the images taken through this camera being high quality generally take about 7-12 mb of storage and i think i may need a microsd in the future when videos and images start piling up.\\nDesign : I have a Halo White version; looks superb! Both at the back and front gives a brilliant look\\nVideo Quality : There is an unnecessary sharpness for videos in medium/low quality; making the image look very unnatural. If previously you have been a SAMOLED user, like me , the video quality may disappoint you a bit. However when the resolution is high ie 720p+, the video quality on the whole phone gets too great!\\nExtension of the Camera at the back - This is one of the most irritating point in this phone; The camera\\'s along with the fingerprint sensor rise a bit above the back\\'s surface, even after i applied the cover, because of this you cant keep the phone anywhere you want. Mostly i keep the phone over a small cloth.\\nMIUI : Superb!\\nHeating : Does get a bit heated up when charging or playing game for a very long time\\nHotspot feature : There is no limit or monitoring on the devices that can be connected to this phone. So, upon setting a password, it automatically connects-disconnects-connects-disconnects on any random device in near range, which can be quite frustrating.\\nAds : Though i already had blocked the Ads option initially , when i started using the phone; but still i receive some ads from some of the inbuilt apps.\\nNetwork issues : No issues faced till now\\nHence overall its a good phone to buy with minor set backs; a really good option if need your phone to be good in the gaming department.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Head phone jack could have kept at the top.\\n3) Low light camera doesn\\'t offer good quality.\\n4) Big phone and uncomfortable to carry in pant pockets.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Save the extra bucks for a year phone bill instead. Don\\'t expect to hold it as it is as its too slippery owning to heavy weight and glass surfaces in either sides. The fast charge is a gimmick. Camera output is pretty good but not the best. Display is quite dismaying, particularly when you been using AMOLED for a long while.

I had to buy this urgently because my previous phone was dead. Otherwise I would have opted for the Realme X2 or the Poco X2 which launched after I purchased this. This one is pretty good but as I mentioned above, there are better options. Battery life is good. Easily lasts a day. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge from 10%. Performance has been superb and multitasking, seamless. Camera quality is average. Don\\'t believe the 64 MP camera hype. Display is big and very good even though it\\'s an LCD display. The phone does get warm but nothing to make you uncomfortable. All in all, it\\'s a good purchase but not the best one in this price bracket.

Feature loaded\\nReviewed in India on 28 February 2020\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\nI am writing this review after using the device (Redmi note 8 pro) for about 15 days. I must say I am pretty surprised to see the capabilities of this device in this price range. First I must mention that 6GB ram n 128GB memory(ROM) in 16k was a steal deal for me. The battery lasts for about a day with more than moderate to quite heavy usage. If I use it with respect battery lasts for about a day n half easy with about 15% juice left. With better t saver it will easily stretch to 2 days with less than moderate usage. Finger print reader is almost accurate for about 4 out of 5 times, it also depends on how perfectly we do the initial scan of finger. Feel is very smooth and display is crisp n very detailed with a premium feel to the touch and response. My only disappointment so far is with the user interface. It does not have any app list like in other OS. MIUI just let\\'s all apps on home screen making it a clutter. So I have to arrange it as per usage.\\nA very important thing to mention here is that though I received a fast charger in the box but it does not do quick charge. I thought it does not show fast charging but it took about 3 n half to 4 hrs to chanrge using the stock charger. Then one fine day I used my powerbank which had fast charging and found it was doing a quick charge and did charge full in 2 hrs. Then I tried it with another charge which I knew was a fast charger and it also charged quick with proper notification on device. So here I don\\'t know how I got a duplicate or defective charger in a sealed box. But I am disappointed with the charger to a great extent. Though I can buy a new one or just use charger of another device but this is the main reason I am deducting 1 star. Thanks for reading. Hope it helps make ur mind.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nVaibhav Mishra\\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST\\nReviewed in India on 3 December 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nI am rating this product 5/5.\\nWell, according to me, this device is a perfect value for üí∞.\\nLet\\'s talk about each and every segment of this device. I am going to give an unbiased review as I am not a MI fan and this is my first MI/Xiaomi device.\\n\\nCAMERA: Pictures captured in day light( normal default mode)contain a lot of details. 64MP doesn\\'t need any introduction. Each 64MP pic varies from 18 MB to 30-35MB in size. They have a lotta details when you zoom in. Portrait shots are awesome too.\\nNight pics are decent too. They are above average. Not as good as Iphone 11 though, of course, but considering the price it\\'s awesome.\\nMacro shots are incredibly awesome. I mean you can just take a pic from 1-2CMs focal distance.\\n\\nULTRA-WIDE lens serves it purpose well, but slightly fades out the colors. The pic from ultrawide in daylight are very good, but indoor lighting are not that sharp and a little bit of lack color saturation, Hope Xiaomi fix it in updates.\\n\\nSPEAKER: SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT, CRISP AND CLEAR. It cannot be compared with STEREO SPEAKERS mobiles like ONEPLUS 7T or S9+ but yes, considering that it is a SINGLE GRILL FIRING SPEAKER, the quality is decent and it\\'s loud enough.\\n\\nNETWORK STRENGTH: NO ISSUES AT ALL. Everything works fine. No call drops, no speed issue\\nBUT NOTE 8 PRO isn\\'t giving me 4G+(CARRIER AGGREGATION) SIGNALS. DON\\'T KNOW WHY. MAYBE NETWORK OPERATOR ISSUE OR MAYBE IT DOESN\\'T SUPPORT INDIAN OPERATORS 4G+.\\n4G WORKS PERFECTLY.\\n\\nDISPLAY: It can\\'t be compared with Amoled or S.Amoled but I just wanna say, I simply don\\'t care. It is bright, and colors are sharp and contrast is very good. It supports HDR+(useful only when you watch HDR content).\\n\\nBATTERY: 4500 MAH, is enough for a moderate user for watching videos , WhatsApp, fb etc. Will easily give you around 1.5 days with still some juice left. If you are a heavy user then it might give you 8-9 hrs backup if you use continuously.\\n\\nDESIGN: SUPERB. IT\\'S HOT. No doubt. Back is just awesome and gives you a premium feeling when you hold this phone.\\n\\nBUILD: The device is around 200GRAMS. It is a bit heavy, but trust me, you will get used to it. And after 2-3 days you won\\'t even feel that it\\'s heavy. It\\'s just getting used to it. Positioning of fingerprint sensor is inaccurate and sometimes you might touch the 3rd camera lens above the sensor. But again, you will get used to it.\\n\\nCAMERA BUMP is there, so use a good quality case to protect it.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE: HELIO G90T+ 6GB RAM(MINIMUM), CMON, it won\\'t show you any lags. It\\'s buttery smooth even for gamers. Yes , this CHIPSET cannot be compared with SNAPDRAGON 855+ but still, after one level, all are decent ones.\\n\\nRAM management is decent too, and switching between the apps is smooth and lag free.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s an awesome device.\\nAs first customer of Xiaomi, I am happy with the device.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\n‚ÜêPrevious page\\nNext page‚Üí\\nQuestions?

Go for it.\\nReviewed in India on 29 January 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nAt the given price, we couldn\\'t ask for anything more than what this phone offers, but there are a few flaws which needs to be highlighted too.\\n\\n1. The vibration alert is literally very less, and I often miss several calls. It\\'s difficult to realise while walking on a quiet road, and impossible while riding a bike. The speakers are also just okay, and again, feels inadequate to hear the ringtones while in a noisy environment. So be prepared for it if you spend a lot of your time while out there in the traffic.\\n\\n2. The camera specs looks great on the paper, but are totally overrated. Forget about zooming into your 64MP photographs and getting the flawless details which the company was boasting of. During normal usage, the camera produces good photographs, while the 2x zoom is useless. Also, the ultra-wide shot loses several details, so there wouldn\\'t be any point in clicking a noisy photograph. Low light performance is just okay with loss of details, but not satisfactory. Rest assured, if you\\'re in properly lit environment and the subject is right in front of you, the camera is surely going to produce some very good photographs.\\n\\n3. The battery life is okay for max 1.5 days of normal usage.\\n\\n4. The LED indicator on the top is quite dim and wouldn\\'t get your attention unless you look for it.\\n\\n5. The screen doesn\\'t light up properly if you\\'re out during the day and take out your phone to attend a call. You\\'ll need to turn OFF the screen, and then again turn it ON by pressing the power button to see who\\'s calling you.\\n\\n6. The proximity sensor doesn\\'t work properly after you\\'re done with the phone call and want to disconnect the call. The screen wouldn\\'t turn ON when you remove the phone from your ear. Again, you would\\'ve to press tbe power button twice to turn the screen ON again.\\n\\nIt surely is a phone with a great value for money, but Xiaomi shouldn\\'t promote it like it\\'s THE BEST one in the world, especially that 64MP camera. The quad camera setup needs better software integration for better performance I guess..\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nBikash Ranjan Dash\\nNeed to optimize camera zooming feature.\\nReviewed in India on 6 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nEverything works great as per the description but the only change that should be made is that, after zooming the photo it becomes pixelated, all the plane areas looks like there is some black dots all over the place.

However, having set up the device I started facing issues with the headphone jack. Every single time I connected any Aux device to the phone, the connection was intermittently interrupted and the music/media would automatically pause for that reason, thus creating issues with continuous playback.\\nPursuant to the same I got a replacement done and received a new device. However I am still facing the same connectivity issues with the Aux jack with no immediate remedy in sight. It seems most probably a software issue, however quite disappointing to have to face this on a new Mi device. Perhaps and hopefully the same may get remedied with future updates.\\n\\nComing to the rest of the phone, it is simply great for the price bracket that it belongs to. Would have given a top rating had I not faced the said issue over and over again.\\nOne person found this helpful\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nArpit Deb\\nBusted Signals\\nReviewed in India on 26 February 2020\\nVerified Purchase\\nThe phone has BAD ANTENNA, Celullar, Wifi and GPS. I dont mind the first two, as I live in a City and it does not get very bad, and in case I need Wifi access I come closer to the router at home. The one that is most painful is the GPS.\\nAs we nowadays always use MAPS, and the phone will constantly put your location wrong.

But to be honest this device doesn\\'t live upto it\\'s hype. The camera is okish, battery though huge last only a day in little heavy to more medium usage. The MIUI needs to be twicked a lot the gesture control is poor ,no night mode in front cam. The back cam night mode still is pretty average. Screen is good personally I would have liked more brightness when outdoors. The MIUI is feature packed.

Worst display I ever found on a midrange smartphone. Reelme c2 is better than it\\'s display even though it has hd display. Colour are wshed off, high sharpnes ruined the video clarity. Not mine only all the devices.. Please check YouTube reviews about RN8 display. Don\\'t buy this. My real me 3 pro is far better than this one.. Only pros is helio G90T.

I have a 50Mbps plan but then it is unable to browse Instagram or twitch etc. Do not waste your money based on the youtube reviews as this device didn\\'t even receive android 10 updates till date. After 3 months of usage, all I can say is that try other available options.

It raises the performance bar in the 15-20K category courtesy of its unlikely hero, the Mediatek Helio G90T SoC. The system and graphics performance are excellent at this price point and probably the best you can get with any chipset south of the Snapdragon 845. The photography department is more than decent and can get even better if some of the chinks are ironed out through software updates. While I had the 6GB variant.\\nBut to state it simply, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is better than the Realme XT in terms of sheer performance, gaming included. Their cameras are evenly matched in terms of specifications and image quality both, and so are their aesthetics.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nsidhant verma\\nRead before buy....\\nReviewed in India on 14 February 2020\\nSize name: 8+128GBColour: Electric BlueVerified Purchase\\nProcessor is pretty good but heating of the phone is on another level . I am writing this in winter think about in summer how much will it heat maybe they give an update or something so the heating got some less. Phone have no issue but camera quality is not that good. And in this price they must give ips display . But the display size is big and fully notch from corner to corner. Apps load very quickly. I have 8 gb and 4.8gb was always in used don\\'t know why.? If you are buying for gaming its very good but in pubg sometimes it shut off immediately without any warning sign and that\\'s sucks.

It has much space, fast mobile charging, fingerprint sensor, quickly face recognize, Alexa, Google Assistant, Screen Recorder, Nice cameras, Good look and feel.\\n\\nFew things needs to be considered more -\\n1. Casting feature needs improvement, the mobile screen does not get cast directly. Tried all the way even by connecting the mobile and TV with same WIFI. I wrote to Redmi service twice but they did not respond at all. Casting only work from Google Photo and YouTube application directly and that too lagging in voice and picture.\\n2. Too much MI applications preinstalled, you may need to remove them once you receive the phone.\\n3. Whatever app you install, all those are put on desktop. There is nothing where Apps are put inside and only shortcuts are put on home screen.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nShahrukh Ansari\\nWorst Phone Performance and Worst Battery Performance\\nReviewed in India on 11 January 2020\\nSize name: 6+128GBColour: Halo WhiteVerified Purchase\\n* Hanging issue.\\nPhone is hanging again and again.

Latest update to MiUi 11. Good camera and Ads can be disabled while booting the phone for the first time. Full HD+ Display Res could have been much better. PPI is reduced to 395 when compared to the redmi note 7 pro which had 409, doesn\\'t make a huge difference but adjusts to full brighteness in daylight. Fingerprint is really spot on and fast. Apps load in quick and RAM management is pretty good. Have been using it for more than 2 weeks. Call quality is good and battery is pretty good, 18W charger and charges completely from 0-100 in 1:50 hrs. I get two complete days of battery backup on frequent browsing and operating the phone. Also comes in with the lasted RAM and UFS storage. Gorilla glass 5 front and back. Only disadvantage is that the phone weighs close to 200 gms and feels heavier on single hand usage. Camera is decent and if you are a professional photographer you can switch over to Pro mode. Overall a satisfied and good purchase for a budget phone.\\nHelpful\\nComment Report abuse\\nsamama abubaker\\nFeel the premium phone.\\nReviewed in India on 13 November 2019\\nVerified Purchase\\nIam using this phone since 3 week I personally liked this phone.Because in the 20k segment this phone is a beast. Iam a heavy user I used this phone mostly for gaming purpose, and also photography\\nLiterally i play pubg for more than 4 hours daily with the graphics settings of(HDR + ULTRA) and also with (Smooth + Extreme)\\nIn this settings I don\\'t faced any lag. But but in (HDR + ULTRA) I faced frame drops below 15 FPS.\\nBut in the case of (Smooth+ Extreme) we can play upto 60FPS. But in some places like when we (hotdrop) mean if we surrounded with many enemys then the FPS will dropped below 45FPS.\\nBut all-over the gaming experience is good.\\nBut Also in the higher graphics setting the phone gets heated upto 40 degree that not a big problem because it will cool down immediately after putting phone idle for 2-3 minutes. So the liquid cooling helps to reduce the temperature fastly.\\n\\nPROS:\\n1:The battery life of the is good if you are a light user then it will runs upto 2and a half day for a heavy user the battery will last upto 1 day.\\n2: The design of this phone is really amazing and also in the hand it will feel like a premium phone.\\n3: Both the front and the back is protected with the gorilla glass 5.\\n4: This phone has a LED notification light and also it has a ir blaster which I personally liked it.\\n5: All-over the gaming experience is smooth in this phone.\\n6: The 64mp camera will takes a good photos.\\n7: The front 20mp shooter is also pretty good.\\n8: A bigger screen of 6.53 inches.which provides a better experience in gaming.\\n9: IP52 rating for dustproof and splash proof.\\n10: This phone has a good processor Helio G90T. The score of this phone is above 282k.\\n\\nCONS:\\n1: The speaker quality is below average.\\n2: The Brightness of this phone low.\\n3: Company should provide the super amoled display.\\n4: video recording of this phone is very poor.\\n5: While gaming at highest graphics the phone will started heating.\\n6: The camera bump is too big if we put a back case on it then also it will not cover the camera bump.\\n7: fingerprint sensor is too small and also the placement of the fingerprint sensor is bit wrong.\\n8: 4g connectivity support in 2019 end.

comments report abuse abhiishek mohta the redmi note pro is powered by the mediatek g t gaming processor  ed in india on november verified purchase redmi note pro specifications inch full hd p display mediatek g t octa core processor gb or gb ram with gb or gb storage with expandable storage support up to gb mp main camera mp ultra wide mp macro mp depth camera mp camera mah battery with w fast charging miui with android pie redmi note pro   camera this is the part which xiaomi is hyping up given there s a mp camera out here the automatic resolution is mp the camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones even at night the selfies are impressive on this phone and it creates a nice depth in portrait mode though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair redmi note pro   performance battery games like asphalt badland nova legacy all ran without any hitches i switched asphalt to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it the graphics looked smooth without any lag in regular usage be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping tabs open on chrome the experience was smooth the only issue i noticed the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long on the battery front the redmi note pro has a mah battery the w fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours with moderate usage you can go up to two days on this phone while heavy duty usage means around one and a half days on the device the redmi note pro runs miui based on android pie xiaomi has said it will get miui by the end of december it does come with alexa pre loaded though google assistant is there as well redmi note pro   design display the redmi note pro has a curved back design though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant one reason is the bigger battery redmi note pro also has a bigger display at inches with the full hd resolution the curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand but the size of the device might not always make it possible the positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either because you will end up touching the lens like i did and covering it with smudges the macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it the idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots the display on the redmi note pro continues to be one of the best for its price it does come with widevine l certification you can stream content at hd or full hd on youtube netflix etc the viewing angles are good and this is a sharp display which works well in most scenarios   helpful comments report abuse sreenivasa reddy facing heat issue and picture quality

comment report abuse pranjal fantastico  ed in india on november verified purchase well you need to wait for this product bought on sale october second sale a premium phone in this range   helpful comment report abuse afzal good phone with nice camera and specs but no support for data transfer  ed in india on november verified purchase glad to be the first one to write a   for this phone the picture clarity in the rear camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of low very low light the mp option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single photo that you will take using this option will be mb going up to mb depending on the details captured in the   the front camera of mp is also very stable and takes good  s it is nice to say that redmi does not apply any default beautification effect to your photos just like realme does actually i had purchased this phone to replace my iphone s however i was totally dissatisfied as there is no software for any data transfer between iphone and redmi for that matter redmi phones do not have any inbuilt application for data transfer from android to android or ios to android which is why the rating is reduced by points it seems to me that redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for first time buyers only so this issue is not addressed and maybe it can be looked into if they want to in comparison if you check for m s from samsung similar specs and price you get a default option of moving your data including sms contacts photos etc without any problems from ios or android about the return option and contacting amazon redmi the customer care at amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase will simply ask you to contact the customer care of apple or redmi whatever are the phones that you have old and new the redmi customer care person will say you can download the apps called xander etc which are of no use and third party apps which won t help at all in any transfer of data please note that though amazon may mention return possible up to nov actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a physically damaged condition which would have to be proved to amazon by sending the photos to them and if they think it is genuine else return is not possible all in all a good phone for first time buyers considering the camera specs and price point but a clear no for migration also if you don t want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy check decide and return then please note that it doesn t work   helpful comment report abuse gaman true game changer nd market gainer  ed in india on november verified purchase mi love tremendous phone killer phone performance is above

verified purchase redmi note pro design solid and well built front back gorilla glass protection with curved edges the camera bump at the back protrudes a little even when the cover is on may be a matter of concern please look for a silicon cover to protect the camera module processor this houses the newest chipset from mediatek helio g t which is basically designed for gaming this not only helps the phone to load play high graphic intensive games fast smooth but it also helps in quick loading and swapping of apps in a day to day usage the overall performance is amazingly fast and buttery those who are complaining of heating issues should buy acs before buying phones for playing games for hours storage ram this comes with the fast ufs onboard storage that help load apps ultra fast as compare to old emmc type storage the basic model starts with gb lpddr ram with dual channel enabled this helps increase the bandwidth by double the data rate as against the single channel ram everything loads amazingly fast with no lags as such supports up to a whopping gb of storage with a dedicated micro sd card slot this is what we want in every phone display ips lcd panel with ppi density and d curved edges this display is of a x resolution with hdr enabled so the colors look very vibrant and true to life the water drop notch looks very nice and it can be disabled from settings personally to me the display looked very crisp and sharp the brightness of this display can go up to nits which is very bright and display looks amazingly sharp and crisp k hdr video quality on youtube is amazing on this display camera this is where it exceeds all other phones the default mp camera takes nice pictures in all modes the mp mode can be enabled from the camera app and it captures amazing pictures with great clarity colours and contrast the pictures with mp camera come out to be very crisp and with lots of details but the   size for mp camera would be approximately around mb per picture this can record the videos up to k resolution however full hd videos will have an electronic stabilization enabled by default which produces great videos macros also come very crisp considering that this is a mobile camera but not the dslr front mp camera also captures wonderful selfies with lots of detail this can record videos up to full hd resolution this phone does a great job in camera department this will surely satisfy your hunger for great pictures those who are looking for gcam support should take mobiles that support it or should buy google phones instead of complaining about this phone the company has offered a good package with great camera and it does a wonderful job people who are looking for an astonishing clarity camera then they should look for a dslrs or buy flagship phones attaching few pictures for reference connectivity supports dual g volte on both sim cards simultaneously dual band wi fi that increases both upload and download speeds dramatically if connected to wi fi ghz connection comes with bluetooth with le low energy mode on that helps preserve battery drain battery a whopping mah battery with quick charge support verdict one word a monster in all aspects be it a design style battery display and camera except its weight of gms this is one piece of art and technology that nobody wants to miss having it every product will have their own issues and bugs including flagships that can be fixed with a software update and every product cannot be compared with another since everything has its own existence and importance

graphics display butter smooth display quit large and excellent display best in claass but will not produce colours as super amoled just a littel bit of diferrence between the two but you will not find much differance in day to day life so full marks for display battery i will say a decent battery life considering inch display and a a heavy processor camera this is the biggest of alll and i am giving you a detailed   for this camera is superb no doubt even in low light it performes vary well and after zooming the photos you will not get blur  s at all potrait mode is one of the best in this segments but now the cons of camera slow motion and wide camera are poor vary poor quality i am not impressed at all slow motion video you can capture only from short or close distance otherwise not good at all and even you cant shoot in artificial lights is well and wide camera does not produces good quality pictures macro camera is excellent and the last con of camera i compaired this camera with iphone xr and vivo v pro in terms of details it is totally equall to them but colours of the pics is not that great but decent in comaprison you will find colours bitt dull but that does not mean they are better they only produces better colour otherwise same but one thing to notice both iphone and vivo captures the colour more saturated than orignal even they dont produces real colours redmi shows littel light colours than real and xr iphone and vivo littel dark than orignal camera is vary good and you will get good pictures and for colour you can adjust them with some photo editing so no issues final verdict on camera is that it is a good camera and you will not be disspointed worth the money you spend great display good camera good battery good built quality littel heavy sound lacks dolby quality camera slow motion and wide angel not good i will say only compititor for this phone is vivo z x in this price segment you can buy any of this phone depends on your demands   helpful

price  ed in india on november verified purchase first look the phone handles like a beauty didnt have any ads poppin up like all the  s given in the net although thre were some apps installed without my permission the main camera is good but the front camera is just trash but can be made better using some camera apps installing the poco launcher is really helpful because people who were using phones from other brands also might get a similar interface im one of the first people to buy the electric blue colour it does give a rather eye catching touch but might feel a little too shiny for regular use   after weeks of use the phone still handles like a beauty i ve tried a few games and all in high settings and they worked wonderfully didn t really experience any heating issues too the battery is amazing u can use it with ease for days the main camera after comparing with many of the new phones released recently have given this phone the throne for one of the best smartphone camera

name gbcolour halo whiteverified purchase the xiaomi redmi note pro is an upgrade over the note pro in almost every count at least on paper in the real world there is a boost in gaming performance and display quality while the added alexa integration will be welcomed by some the camera quality remains more or less the same despite a newer sensor and that s not necessarily a bad thing addressing a few burning issues we initially concluded the note pro might be overheating during longer gaming sessions while the phone does run warmer than say the realme pro it doesn t go beyond degrees which is what we consider overheating in smartphones the battery life of the phone is just as good as its predecessor despite a larger battery by the looks of it xiaomi took a bold step by choosing to go with a mediatek flagship soc and it seems to have paid off there s no reason why shouldn t buy the redmi note pro save for the pesky ads in the ui redmi mi   helpful comment report abuse nikhil songara

india on january verified purchase first time ever this smartphone from xiaomi disappointed me as i was a xiaomi fan since second smartphone from xiaomi that is redmi s launched in india after s i had used many xiaomi smartphones from redmi note redmi note redmi note redmi prime mi i mi a poco f redmi note redmi note pro and mi but first time ever i am disappointed with any xiaomi smartphone and that phone is none other than redmi note pro i had even visited redmi note pro launch event and there they showcased this smartphone that good that i wanted to purchase it so finally i did buy the phone thinking about all these features like cooling pipe gaming centric smartphone and all but finally after spending that much money it was all worthless as the phone screen was not that good buying it for rs k ignoring the screen camera was disgusting and most importantly phone was getting heated as well while playing pubg only for about minutes which is disgusting to spend this much and getting nothing and the most disgusting was that i had gone with the halo white color which does looks shabby and cheap smartphone without cover so either covers it forever or use it hiding with everyone last words never go for this smartphone ever this was disgust phone ever which looked shabby bulky and overpriced   helpful comment report abuse krishna rocking note pro  ed in india on november verified

blacks are very good for lcd even thought the contrast ratio mentioned is around k but totally satisfied with the contrast colors etc it even out shined my older samsung a pro with its hdr videos in you tube gaming is good played asphalt for few hours at max settings and did not find much lags and the game is enjoyable without much heating either battery standby is v good no loss in standby even in night not even even thought the screen android consumes a bit more battery than desired but still its nice and fast charging is also fine built quality is super got white color and loved it i wanted green but couldn t get that in sale so have to buy white but have to say it is very good i love the curves in the side which makes handling a pleasure use big phones so i needed big size and could have gone for bigger also but not disappointed with this size also pretty good the weight is also ideal with not more than which doesn t feel heavy finger print is fast and face is reliable and fast without opening in eyes closed case ui is fast and filled with customization i downloaded poco launcher instantly as i needed app drawer and its great both cameras are ok in indoor lighting not very great as i could not use it outdoors yet thanks xiaomi for this great product and such price and thanks amazon for getting the same in just days time without any extra charges   helpful comment

comment report abuse bk redmi note pro your typical redmi note gets a premium makeover  ed in india on november verified purchase thus the redmi note pro happens to be xiaomi s first smartphone with a mp samsung sensor a gaming oriented mediatek helio g t chipset powering the device instead of the usual qualcomm mid range chipset and a battery unit that has been increased to mah that said the rivalry between xiaomi and realme has picked up frantic pace over the course of with both companies trying to outpace the other at every step having been the brand that has stood at the summit of india s smartphone market for eight straight quarters the company certainly doesn t want to lose out relative newbies realme meanwhile is breaking records of its own gaining a market share of within just months of existence so does the redmi note pro do enough to warrant the spotlight for yet another iteration read on to find out build and design the redmi note pro is hands down the most attractive looking redmi note series phone till date it s striking but not over the top and that s precisely why i ve loved how xiaomi s gone about the design here it s also worth noting that xiaomi s typically been a brand that doesn t revise their product designs often enough they changed that with the redmi note pro earlier this year and eight months down the line they ve changed it up again this time adding it a little more oomph to the mix a good display that could have been better on the front the redmi note pro gets a inch fhd ips lcd panel the screen itself is seemingly identical to what xiaomi fielded in this segment earlier this year and you get decent colors and zero issues with sunlight legibility but when you pay attention to competition though namely the realme xt you do get an amoled screen that has more vibrant colors the reason why the comparison between lcd and oled comes up every time is because black levels and contrast aren t exactly as good on an lcd panel as the amoled screen on the realme xt however the difference in quality isn t huge either the panel on the redmi note pro is just as good as lcd panels get and if you re someone who streams a ton of video content on your phone you ll definitely have a great experience redmi note pro performance and software xiaomi definitely raised eyebrows when they decided to go with a mediatek soc in the note pro despite the qualcomm snapdragon doing an excellent job in the redmi note pro in fact it was a big risk and the scales could have tipped either way but as it turns out this was a brilliant decision

great the only thing that concerns me is the screen that doesn t capture the touches when we type faster than a certain wpm so the typing problem is still there now i have activated autocorrection and

whiteverified purchase i usually don t   products on amazon but this one deserves special mention so here we go in the box you get handset watt fast charger and a cover no screen guard inside the box the cover deserves an especial mention it s similar to oneplus cover and has that usb flap to protect phone from water damage the handset white looks almost magical there are trays side by side which can accommodate sims and a microsd on the top you will find an ir blaster nothing new if you are a returning xiaomi customer but if this is your first then just use it once and see how handy it is in controlling tv ac and other remote control appliances bottom has a single speaker grill mm jack and usb type c switching on it gives a haptic feedback which is quite tuned rather than the rude vibration that redmi note pro gives xiaomi has worked hard to fine tune the device and it has paid well now starts the real torment there are tons of options guiding you to customize the phone as you prepare for our maiden voyage and options for ads are kinda well hidden but more about it later ui now let your eyes and mind get accustomed to miui there s no app drawer and all apps are neatly grouped into folders there s a lot of bloat but thank the sweet lord it s uninstallable i would advise you to enable developer options and reduce the animations to x the phone will be noticeably faster and less animated display the hdr display is vibrant and bezels are negligible one of the best ever seen on redmi note series camera of course it s the camera phone with monstrous mp primary sensor my initial impressions were good but camera tends to saturate dark colors quite a bit and wide angle has quite noticeable distortion scared yet don t be cuz even after these caveats the camera performs well specially with pro mode do not use mp mode the noise increases quite a bit gcam here s our sweet savior again xiaomi has left camera api enabled so installing gcam is pretty easy right now the best one has been developed by wyroczen and you can find all about it by a single google search the gcam corrects most errors of he camera but do not use macro mode it s much better on stock camera speakers the single speaker doesn t really satisfy people who ve used stereo speakers but this fact can t take away the limelight off note pro the speaker is loud crisp and has a good bass due to bigger cavity connectivity it is quite good and works fine haven t seen g or carrier aggregation though verdict redmi note pro is a fine phone with little to compromise upon surely a great effort from xiaomi once again ps pardon any typos   helpful comment report abuse samy pubg gaming degrees amaozn says its ok  ed in india on november verified purchase just want to inform all the buyers this

comment report abuse rohith v the best gaming phone under k and best rear camera and smooth processor  ed in india on july verified purchase this is the best gaming phone under k after days of usage i am going to explain the pros and cons pros the flagship performance in gaming pubg in hdr graphics and and the frame rate in ultra there is no lag or frame drop i found even though i saw the frame drop inoneplus t the best rear camera in this segment and the super macro camera the night is not good the charges to in hour minutes which is good the best lcd display i have ever seen it competes with my old samsung a amoled display which costs around k the ultra fast fingerprint sensor works perfectly the decent performing selfie camera which is good in this price it has slight heating issue when u play games at outdoor but its not the major problem because it has liquid cool technology it has the best media tek helio g t processor is better than snapdragon g and g the redmi is giving proper and quick software updates if you are heavy pubg gamer it is the best option but dont spend extra k on gb ram the gb ram is more enough the phone performs smoothly cons main issue is battery life it comes to and half hour battery backup in heavy gaming but the company claims hours gaming but if u use instagram fb and youtube it comes around one day battery backup it contains ads and pre installed apps which cant be uninstalled we can do only force stop the headphone jack audio output is not good and mi video app is waste use mx player it is so good the in built transparent backcase

half months for a loss of over k this is the worst decision i ve ever made the network quality is very low and the calls drop very frequently and the service is very very bad   helpful comment report

glass front and back the camera bump on the rear is on the big side hefty for the screen size at g it s slippery like glass backs tend to be so using a case is recommended display good quality bright inch ips panel with very good sunlight legibility supports hdr a rare find in this price range software miui is one of the more refined and smooth android skins around and has a number of add on features and a lot of customizability it s not as clean and minimalistic as stock android though in the default setup you will get both plenty of bloatware and ads in the ui performance excellent best in class performance with the powerful helio g t on board that performs around the same level as last year s flagship snapdragon the redmi note pro sails through anything you throw at it this is essentially a top end gaming phone on the cheap and it has a significant edge in benchmarks over it s main competitor the realme xt that packs the snapdragon camera the note pro once again delivers some superlative camera performance for the price bracket as the note pro series has done for a few years now especially from the main mp camera the quad camera setup on the rear includes a mp primary camera mp ultra wide mp depth sensor mp macro lens the main mp sensor is versatile and delivers excellent  s at day and night it is also capable of some surprisingly good x digital zoom photos eliminating the need of a cheap telephoto lens the mp selfie camera is also pretty good great video recording quality overall overall this is now the best camera phone under inr k with a slight edge over the other great camera phone of this price bracket the realme xt with clearer low light photos and slightly sharper  s the macro and ultra wide cameras are uninspiring for high quality photos you will want to stick to the main camera video recording in p could have been a bit better audio excellent headphone audio weak ish mono speaker while okay it isn t very loud or crisp battery outstanding class leading battery life with a mah cell and a super efficient chipset you will comfortably get days of use and more supports usb pd w fast charging that can charge the phone from to in about

formats all text   and video  s   and video  s only all text   and video  s showing of  s uday singh a great budget phone for manual photography and gaming  ed in india on january verified purchase here s my full and honest   for those who wanna buy it it s kind of hard to get the features it gives in such a small price range it surpasses most phones in similar price range for following reasons the cpu even though it uses mediatek chip which is cheap and inferior to snapdragons it runs all of its cores on stable ghz not like others which have cores running at ghz and rest of the are at better buy the gb ram version to get the most out of it because this mediatek chip somehow performs at par or even better than snapdragon processors that come within the similar price range however it doesn t always run at full speed but only when needed this gives some problems like occasional lags when quickly opening high memory apps while phone is in calm mode for too long liquid cooled again for this price range it s amazing however you need to keep the phone covered with plastic case comes in the box to make it work flawlessly it s because the heat from your hands can easily get transferred to the inside fluid and interfere with convection currents that keep the phone cool using a plastic cover helps insulate it multiple antennae the g g cellular reception on this phone is so good that you re practically never out of signal in the areas where most people struggle to get a single bar although it s aimed for gamers who need stable connection for online gaming it s a big boon for everything else wifi hotspot works way better than any other phone large battery out of box fast charger and usb type c again for a phone this cheap it s a steal battery lasts very long because they didn t just pump this phone with fast cpu and large battery but the way this phone handles everything is actually very efficient that gives you smooth experience while keeping the battery running for long there are some noticeable glitches though like sometimes phone takes a while to go from battery saving to full performing mode and that creates lags but thankfully those lags aren t uncommon even in most expensive android phones so for this small price you should live with it because your other option for total zero lag free experience would be to spend x money and buy the iphone and once apple releases new ios that will start lagging too cameras this phone has total cameras while most of them weren t necessary and are uselessly overhyped the main reasons to buy this are a the color contrast you get in the final clicked picture of mp that combines the data from multiple sensors this is unmatched and you ll love the pictures shot in regular photo mode b the pro mode with manual controls sec shutter iso for main camera and stable lens focus even without ois best for astrophotography macrolens works best in pro mode where you can get nearest focus for some very detailed microscopic shots you also get other stuff like metering control pocket mode where it locks screen while still recording peak overlay to show you what s in focus and what s not timelapse with control over intervals manual controls don t apply to front camera and for other two sensors shutter speed is very limited and final pictures are very blurry and have no detail whatsoever at iso higher than the camera app is native to redmi software and doesn t support timelapse in manual mode and other apps like camerafv don t work so well with bracketing timelapse proshot doesn t work at all you can shoot timelapse in native app but then you won t get manual controls which is useless for night c all sensors are larger than usual phone sensors which means better details in low light in all modes but it doesn t mean they all capture good detail the macro lens gives worst  s and ultrawide isn t any good at all if you want detailed  s only the main sensor with its pixel binning does the actual job d p fps and p fps video encoded in x fast and efficient rest of slowmo modes are low performing misguided and not very useful fps mode is there but it captures only seconds of footage with the fps slowmo applied only to the last second you have to time your shot very precisely to get it right there s no sound alert for when it will begin slowmo also it isn t native fps more like fps with merged frames to make it look like fps capture very fast moving objects like shooting an arrow from bow or vibrating guitar string and you ll get the artifacts that make it look so fake and ugly still there are things where redmi could have utilized their budget somewhere else like macro lens and ultrawide aren t very practical not just for this phone but they aren t practical in most phones ultrawide gives you wider view but distorts the periphery and people in edges and in this phone both ultrawide and macro lenses use low res sensors mp for macro and mp for uw and they aren t good in low light and even in full daylight they give much lesser detail and color contrast than the main sensor and the mp s full mp don t look any good when zoomed in to so don t expect to get sharp  s from small sectors of a full mp photo but it helps create a very sharp and detailed mp photo by combining pixels from mp sensor with data from other two cameras which is kinda better than most expensive phones can do also separating foreground from background is done very good probably because of its ai learning and camera depth information works well for front camera too it can even separate individual hair strands in some cases if lighting is good and subject doesn t move which is at par with what iphone pro does with camera unit operating system and functions usually the custom android builds kind of tarnish the performance but that isn t the case with this phone here s what i liked about it a it gives the freedom to use your own launcher homescreen app which many other custom ui androids don t provide b the gaming mode is one of the best things about it when playing fullscreen games like pubg clashofclans etc you can swipe a corner and use whatsapp facebook and browser in small sidebar like area without leaving the game even keyboard turns into short floating version to help typing while keeping the game under eye there is also a neat option to turn off display while keeping the game running without locking your phone c you can record the screen while gaming which is fast and doesn t stress the system performance while recording but during the recording mode the audio get desynced from what s going on in the game this also happens if you connect wireless headphones or cast the screen to your tv monitor but this isn t a redmi issue it happens in every device when you record cast audio or video wirelessly d fingerprint sensor works flawlessly there are no mismatches so far as i ve used hope it stays that way e native call recorder in calling screen which records both your voice and caller s voice in neat detail unlike most phones where you can t hear other person in recording unless they re on speaker final verdict a great phone to have for this price it isn t just a cheap phone because price is cheap it s actually a good device with good battery and smooth performance everywhere there are some areas where redmi could ve done better instead of putting four cameras but then again you re getting what other phones can t give you even at double the price so i shouldn t be complaining about this at all   helpful comment report abuse akarsh rastogi worst phone buying

usage drains very fast on heavy use gps very slow and inaccurate offilne maps doesn t work ever with just gps rn p was slick and accurate all in all the only things i bought this phone for are useless

you buy  ed in india on january verified purchase okay guys this is the   that you would want to read before you buy this phone bought this as a new year present to self n now after two days of usage this is what i ve to say pros battery life guys the battery is huge n after one charge previous morning n one full day of heavy usage it s still showing of juice left in it fingerprint reader it s as good as they come no problem whatsoever works like a dream design staple mi design the quad cam setup with finger print reader is perfectly positioned it s not premium but hey i m not complaining processor n ram i m using the gb variant ram optimisation is brilliant g with octa core ghz is doing the job wonderfully well alexa for all those alexa fans it s a welcome feature at no extra cost miui comes with miui global which is smooth n user friendly nd i m sure the latest patch will be available soon budget this is reasonably priced considering the competition in the segment cons weight this is a huge phone n hence it s bulky n after some time ur hand starts to pain camera quality i was a bit disappointed with the camera quality considering it s a quad cam setup with mp as primary but hey it s okay at this price single hand operation found it a lil difficult owing to its size overall feel not very premium polycarbonate back looks n feel very cheap overall i would say it s a good budget buy with all those features don t go looking for something extraordinary then u will enjoy it lastly a word about amazon delivery ordered at h in evening n received at h in the morning

the phone s pretty good if not exceptional for the price some of the major pros are excellent mp camera good battery life with decent fast charging notification led very fast and snappy with good call

much bump of the camera so be careful with that or use a good quality back cover for protection camera depth details can be seen very clearly hdr is good nd because of hdr is available in all the way wide angle is gud macro lens is clear but not that much i expected but in this price range it is best video at k overall good performance the main and the foremost thing that everyone thinks about the perfomance nd now this beast comes with helio g t which is too much powerful processor for gaming multitasking nd power packed work pubg cod plays at higher resolution at ease the best performance and gaming phone in this budget design the back glass is with gorilla glass and it luks amazing with different colour i prefer white for attractive luk but for elegant luks u can go for gamma green battery charging it comes mah battery which works well a day or more if u are heavy usager so it can give up to day to u nd for normal users it can give more than a day charging is gud but w charger seems to be more faster than it is it takes around hours to charge from to overall i think at this price range redmi note pro is the king of all or u can say a beast   helpful comment report abuse

pro as i was planning to go for samsung m s but since i have used redmi for many years i decided to use same brand when i got the mobile first i was surprised and very happy that it had option like slow motion in camera and most importantly it has dedicated memory card slot which is generally not available in china models but within one week i started noticing the mobile was slow sometimes getting hung very often and gets very hot after using just to browse facebook for hours even when charging the mobile gets too hot it is a real disappointment i also checked with couple of other who purchased redmi and redmi note pro during same time of sale and all of them have the same problem so i am not sure if redmi offered the discount price just to sell of their defective piece unfortunately the problems started after days and so there is no use of exchange as the exchange period is also over a real disappointment and waste of money i would not recommend anyone to buy this mobile redmi had my full faith as i have used redmi mobiles since last years and my wife is using redmi note but this time i should have stuck to my instinct and not got redmi note pro one person

charging but everything failed when i called mi customer care they said i ll have to visit the service centre and there is no other way out but currently due to covid the service centres in my area in mumbai are all shut and hence this phone is just lying dead in my cupboard this is a very sad thing as my money is stuck i can t buy a new phone or get it replaced as the window has passed or even get it to the service centre overall a very bad experience as u would not want a phone to be dead within one month of u purchasing it tried speaking to amazon customer care multiple times but because of

verified purchase though i am a big fan of redmi note series phones and have been using since note g time but this time it disappointed me a lot because of very poor audio quality and the issue with the grip of the phone camera quality could have been better although its a mega pixel but quality id very bad i think xioami needs to rethink on their strategy of quickly producing various models just to be in the market rather they should focus on stability in the market by providing quality product by taking good time to design develop and market i am not liking at all writing such feedback for redmi phone but quite disappointed this time one person found this helpful helpful comment report abuse siva sankar p g worst camera and worst software experience  ed in india on february verified purchase camera is the worst the quad setup is as gimmicky as it can try taking a shot with zoom even x zoom the   will get distorted so much you don t even want to look at it if you go beyond that it gets all blurry i tried taking pic of slides from a distance of less than meters and the   quality is utter rubbish the attached pic is taken from within meters distance and with no zoom and you can see the lack of clarity software is really buggy auto rotate option sucks you have to keep the rotate off all the times otherwise you ll have lot of problems with apps as they open in landscape mode even when you are holding up right after using a month i really feel it doesn t worth the money or hype battery performance is the only saving grace for this phone and by the way no proper security updates as well in the rush to make too many phones the company is forgetting the basic fulfillments to satisfy the already existing customer base update after months received android update the auto rotate issues has been fixed however the update came up with more bugs while browsing websites you can t accept popups as the screen will be irresponsive screen becomes suddenly irresponsive while using various apps high end games get stuck from the very beginning asphalt etc and many more software issues along with heavy heating one person found this helpful helpful comment report abuse amazon

honest   writing after full analysis of the redmi note pro really decent product no issues with breakages quick   battery display processor camera build and design detailed   battery uses a w battery but i think the miui is not much optimised for the better battery life the drainage is really quick even without gaming though you get a w fast charger but still takes a good amount of time to charge display its a full hd screen also the display is sharp but what disappointed me was it s standard hz refresh rate which at this price point is a necessity the good thing is you get hdr support for youtube processor the mediatek helio g t is a beast for gaming you can play smooth extreme and still this a good processor at this price point the bad side is it starts to heat after continues gaming and also a little bit warm when using the phone for daily tasks camera the megapixel is good the macro camera works perfect you have p fps video recording also k fps supported the slow mo is fps is also quite impressive but overall a good camera phone but not the best build and design the design looks glossy and good finished the water drop notch looks a bit old but can be used has a shiny and pretty glass back which makes it vulnerable to scratches i hope you use a back cover the fingerprint sensor is on the back but would be better if it was on the power button or on screen the thing which makes it less abstract is it s weight and with the back cover on it feels pretty heavy final verdict the redmi note pro is a good value for money phone out there and if you are interested you should buy it but it has some better alternative which would be worth using no problems with packing no scratches or damage was found on the phone kindly upvote   helpful comment report abuse indrajit

signature in the alexa app gorrilla glass protection gg has improved scratch resistance and can withstand a drop from shoulder height that gg could not amoled vs ips my experience of the ips phones and amoled ones we own one plus asus zenfone max pro samsung galaxy j and mi i find note pro my fav maybe due to hdr galaxy j has some burn in issues also i checked and one plus was not advertised for hdr battery please turn location off and disable the dark mode don t touch bloatware miui has some very decent features the battery is stressed if charged below and heated when we charge above the w charger can charge from to in less than an hour i have android and miui and the note can last a full day with charge please avoid overnight charge as the battery will overheat and it detrimental for it s life hdr is available on note pro with a brightness of nits the first thing i check if i have to buy a tv or projector is hdr which is very important for a display and is much different than hd ready or fhd or qhd here hdr gives you over billion colors per pixel fhd has pixels redmi note pro is one of the very few midrange mobiles to boast of hdr refresh rates a human eye can differentiate upto to frame rates per second or hz most hollywood movies are shot at frames per second or hz why do we want hz it not only drains the battery but also loads the processor what we should talk about is the touch screen refresh rate note pro screen has a touch rate of per sec and it is evident in the performance most phones have a touch sampling rate of our human eye can see better than k that is the reason for the advent of k there is liquid cooling technology infrared port and a signal booster which are important when needed i researched for months before replacing my asus zenfone max pro and am very happy it s a rolls royce so you must learn to drive it to harness it s full potential alexa alone is a compelling enough reason that i will not look at any other phone helpful comment

not facing any lags well i play with smooth extreme graphics settings this is built for gamers and we cant find a phone under k price range for best gaming g t is built for gaming no issues in day to day usage as i installed a lot of apps and still running smoothly i went for a variant as i have a memory card of gb thanks to that extra slot display is quite good in this price range comparing with realme good brightness level and hdr supported build quality is premium nice and handly looks premium just dissappointed with fingerprint sensor built parallel to camera ram management is quite good go for it guys if you are an insane gamer and looking a phone under k price range little bit heating issue is there but not crossed in room temperature while playing pubg in extreme graphics which i prefer but we wont find any lag charging time is about hours from to percent and to percent for to games of pubg thats approx hrs or more speaker quality is normal give likes if u find this usefull

this to play pubg you ll be disappointed i read other  s saying it s good for pubg yes if there is no one near you or if you play tdm it s fine in classic getting a single kill in close range combats is a miracle it doesn t matter which guns are at play even if you have groza and if your opponent has a pistol you would lose frames get dropped a lot to the point where you can t really see what is going on aiming is not possible at all mid range and long range fights are fine you can t rush enemies with this phone for a phone advertised as having a processor optimized for gaming its really not worth its salt ps my   is based on the following graphics settings smooth and medium frame rate no anti aliasing apart from that the battery life is good camera is decent for this price range verdict

torn between samsung m s which was cheaper for great indian sale and realme x on flipkart but redmi note pro had more good  s got discount with credit card for gb ram gb storage samsung has a plastic body vs redmi s gorilla glass front and back which looks premium which was a deciding factor for me camera also is better than samsung has a good battery and w fast charger display is vibrant touch and finger print scanner is quick without lags finger print scanner is right below the camera lens on the back so your finger smudges lens if you are not used to it if you have used front finger print scanner not a big fan of miui coming from pure android disabled all ads and bloatware before first use miui has dark mode which is good this is a powerful phone performance wise only complaint is the ringtone volume is not very loud phone is a bit heavy but the battery is of higher capacity helpful comment report abuse shah not much as i expected  ed in india on december verified purchase i ve got this phone two weeks back and have been using it for the past ten days fingerprint reader fast accurate and good screen size neither too big nor too small just as what we want display clarity you may think that this phone lacks amoled display but trust me even though using ips lcd its way better but yea you may find the screen brightness not too bright or sufficient enough camera quality this is what i wanted to say about i don t know whether it s just my phone fault or some kind of issue whenever i click pictures it definitely has some distortions or some noise i ve took a lot of photos but still i don t feel it as mp cam phone this is where i want to go for realme xt battery life i was using redmi note pro mah before this one and i seriously don t feel any difference between these two despite this pro having a mah battery quick charge yea just as the name depicts it s quick but not fast enough as you want performance having helio g t as it s core chipset it performs well but there s still a second lag when you clear your memory and return to home screen you can go on gaming without any worry but phone may heat up slightly when you go on gaming for more than mins these issues that i have found may be because of miui where miui has some improvements in system but i won t lie about the camera quality which is not so good as a mp cam ask me if you have any doubts   helpful

phone just doesn t manage call drops and random silences are another thing i already got a replacement for this reason alone but the newer phone is no improvement i narrowly missed the replacement deadline being out of station on work then there are irritations like the message tones not changing to what you set so no matter what you set only the default one rings yes bluetooth plays in ldac which is nice but the ear piece volume is so low that i have to use the handsfree all the time not something that i had a problem with on the nokia in fact my other choice was the nokia and i should have gone for that android one and nokia are indeed a good combination and this glitchy phone reaffirms that ps the auto brightness also doesn t work properly i have to either manually increase it or shade the phone to change the response to the ambient light helpful comment report abuse pradeep kumar good phone with so so cameras  ed in india on march verified purchase it s a good mobile with following pros and cons pro screen size is good display is nice and bright light sensor works good and changes brightness as per light conditions processor if smooth but not as swift as it could be battery will last full day if used hours for normal use it will last and a half day memory card support i have put a gb card thereby getting a capacity of cons selfie camera is good but all other cameras are satisfactory only it takes crispy  s but not with sharp details rather does some make up kind of job night mode makes pic like painting not clear those who are in the fancy of mega pixels should rethink a camera with lesser mega pixel can do wonder this race of mega pixel is useless a little bit heavier than usual because it flaunts gorilla glass front and back but this makes it sexy

beast for the price  ed in india on november verified purchase the variant i bought was the gb storage with gb ram in the gamma green colour design build the colour and design of the back feels premium with gorilla glass protection the curved edge makes it comfortable to hold the phone even though it weighs more than an average phone the weight distribution is done well display the ips lcd panel is excellent and feels premium measuring at it is definitely big but you ll get used to it or not performance the new processor has silenced the critics with impeccable performance i haven t noticed any stutters or glitches multitasking runs smoothly with good ram management battery mah battery is a monster i easily got hrs of screen on time with mins of gaming if you re a casual user it could easily last two days on a single charge the included w charger is an added bonus camera the quad camera is good at the price range but nothing extraordinary low light photos are noisy and could be corrected with gcam or future updates cons at forget about one handed use so if size is a big deal for you this isn t the best choice miui and its ads fortunately you can turn off most of it and delete the bloatware camera isn t professional grade by any means mp is fine and all but that should not be the deciding factor verdict at this price point i would definitely recommend this as it is a good all round phone performance wise this is a beast gamma green and halo white are the best colours of the pack   helpful comment report abuse vaibhav thakkar pathetic chinese product months usage

ed in india on january verified purchase onestopshop peer sheet   directions the rating is mentioned for the product for precise overview the product truly meets beyond our expectation in software and hardware or hardware and seller response the product meets beyond our expectations in hardware but the software needs improvement the product quality is just ok and get s the basic work done the product quality below mentioned standards and hurdles to get the basic work done low product quality and not recommended for the work performance storage design camera quality video quality display resolution battery backup user interface calling experience speaker quality earpiece quality overall experience onestopshop conclusion the video experience is just ok needs to work a lot in the software part user interface is a little difficult to get upon because the absence of app drawer and search bar makes difficult to search for apps sharpness is increased too much which results in strain on eyes and end output also gets affected gb of storage gets the work done as cloud storage takes care of the rest of the content security patches are thrown so aggressively without quality control to meet the competition that sometimes after a security patch update a lot of glitches are observed which ruins the work culture all day battery backup that s a plus the calling experience is above average the focus of the camera needs to be adjusted and optimized as the focus is lost during shooting videos in display fingerprint sensor is slow and messy after a few days of use customer service is below average as the response rate is too slow the phone is ok for day to day use but not a deal breaker product for sure helpful comment report abuse shiva kumar fast and responsive no

after applying silicon case with it the camera bump can be avoided sometime i feel the earpiece is not at right place as when i make a call it sometimes give me low voice and when placed properly at

january verified purchase loved the phone redmi did an awesome job with this phone tho at first the camara was noise and dull but after updating it to miui it is really awesome i cant stop taking pics from the mp now about the performance i would say it gives you the feeling as tho you are playing on a premium phone i played it for hours straight on hdr with high refresh rate the phone can handle itself well i did not face any lag of frame drops there was heating but if you play on max setting of any phone for long hours you will face heating the battery was amazing it lasted for hrs hrs of high setting which left it at percentage and the hours of mild usage i wiuld say the prosessor has to do a lot with powersaving as it ment for performance and saving the wide angle camare still needs work mainly at low light   does come dark but ofcourse that some you will only notice if you do a comparison haptic has modes high is the best you feel life something is ticking you in the pocket when you are riding or driving the audio was a high inprovement after the update now i can hear it from the other room there are cons like if you are swiping very fast if will detect a tocuh anywhere on the screen also when i placed my earphones on it the phone went crazy sadly it managed to uninstall pubg and all i could do was watch as all my data went down the drain but that fine i installed it again the call quality ti good i can hear what people are saying and people can hear what i am saying so no problem there internet speed now that really depends on how far the tower is fron you you will face really slow speeds my airtel is the worst with speed from very good to worst jio vodaphone both sims have g active at once so you you turn on inter on one the other won t goto g idea tho it s part of voda now but not as good as voda airtel the download speeds for jio are at mb s that what i got when i was downloading from plastore speedtest showed mb s i did get mb s but after to am when network traffic is reduced with voda i got kb s to mb s it staded at mb for the most part but there were drops way more the jio ideo had kb s to mb s that was the best i got from it now it s airtel with kb s to kb s i was able to download buy hugh files i was just sitting and watching thr screen you have to keep in mind this is in my area it may be defferent in your area i hope this helps i will

kumar performance beast killer cameras  ed in india on march verified purchase probably the best phone under k or even k it wouldn t be an exaggeration to say that yes it lacks a few things like an amoled display inbuilt fingerprint scanner which it s competitors offer but still this phone beats them when it comes to overall performance the mediatek helio g t processor is no joke this thing scored k on antutu benchmark way ahead than the phones offered on even greater budgets i don t play games but the overall performance is very fluidic when heavily multitasked the camera is another plus point day light shots are phenomenal low light shots are good but the tables turn when you install gcam yes the phone now supports gcam fully right out of the box you just need to install it along with a proper configuration file that s it go for this your eyes closed i m a neophyte when it comes to clicking pictures but you can do better so attaching a few shots shot with gcam astrophotography mode edit love this phone even more learnt to click pictures in pro mode and surprisingly i think they are even better than gcam low light shots i have added a few more pictures for

found the heating issue till now will recommend to others one person found this helpful helpful comment report abuse sajan daniel an all rounder  ed in india on march verified purchase i have been using this phone for around months now and i m quite happy with the performance of the phone the fingerprint scanner is exceptionally fast and has an astute haptic feedback i was particularly happy with the camera quality although the mp option is not really useful as it just eats up all of the disc space it is really cool to have that feature and the photos taken in the mp feature turned on is sharp and crisp and encorporate a lot more details the helio g t processor is really fast and responsive and works pretty well for gaming and for ordinary day to day tasks as well although it being a nm process doesn t really help with the battery life it lasted me hardly a day and i can t quite complain considering the fact that i use the phone a lot and do a lot of heavy gaming like pubg mobile the game runs on high graphic settings by default but if you are a normal user who uses the phone for day to day tasks it would probably last you a day and a half or more the w fast charger provided with the phone charges it pretty quickly considering the mah battery of the redmi note pro although it has an ips lcd screen it s one of the best screens so far with as deep blacks as an amoled screen all in all it s an all rounder of a phone and if you are looking for one that is in the sub rs range then this is definitely a phone that you should check out one person found this helpful helpful comment report abuse deepak i love the quality and camera  ed in india on february verified purchase i would say that this is the best phone available in this price range super built with amazing

device yesterday evening checked it out today and found that the screen has a very erratic response to touches the minimise button locks the phone so no multi apps at a time the display kind of resets and reaches to home and the work being done in an app is lost you need to start all the work again i had to take another phone to write the whole   as this phone kept on refreshing resetting on its own seems i am unfortunate to get a malfunctioning device amazon technical support yielded no response awaiting action from amazon team helpful comment report abuse amazon customer good phone with bad night camera edit and worst network reception  ed in india on january verified purchase the phone is good considering the price point thinks i liked about phone are the display quality is very good considering the ips panel installed on it it gives good competition to amoled the build quality is premium and i liked it so much while colour looks good the camera performance in day light condition is very good audio output is good fingerprint sensor and face unlock is very fast and accurate have done some gaming and performance is very good haven t experience much heating issue phone gets little warm at the back specially near camera setup but cools down quickly the outside temperature plays big roll here touch response and overall ram management is good thinks i didn t like the camera performance at night is terrible as photos captured have lot of noise need fix for it from xiaomi most of the pre installed apps can not be disabled the mi apps and priorities given to these apps e g there was a gesture which will open google search if swipe up is done anywhere on screen however after recent updates it was changed from google search to mi browser overall this is a good buy at this price point and you will not be disappointed at all edit i have been using this device for almost months now i found one major and most important problem with this that is network reception and stability i am currently in low network area when i saw mobile from brands like realme micromax can provide good signal quality and g reception mi devices suck i am getting poor g network with this also after update on miui if you got any call and network changed to g to change it to g i have to restart it again before ota update airplane mode used to work pissed off with this device no exchange offers as well to change it and buy new device please consider this fact before buying mi device specially if you live in low network area go for other brands one person found this helpful helpful comment report abuse shukant sharma outperformer for the price a must buy a tech lovers    ed in india on march verified purchase a user   after using it for days i just love checking out new technology so used this one thoroughly before its   hope you guys get a help buying this beauty news oneplus will come approx around april th k approx price price got it for a deal price of k approx with exchange offer gb gb enough power cameras work like a charm see the clicked pics normal micro and hdr selfies are amazing too low light photos are a lil disappointing not much processor fast like hell heliop t is an underrated performer better than the sd g in pro battery boon for this size makes it work for more than a day easily it will easily take you to late night with heavy use too tip never let any phone battery drain to zero charge it when it s above to full heptic feed a very smooth feedback if set to low os the new miui is super smooth with amazing natural sounds and notifications ps their is a notification led on the front cam best thing to get form factor the phone is on a heavier side due to its battery but redmi note series are always heavy and should be handled with both hands the glass back phones should be cared well for its fragile nature chin is negligible for the price buy a green or blue version for a seamless experience hdr support for the videos in yt and other platforms for the price is amazing alexa inbuilt is one of the mind blowing features of pro missing in all other phones use it and be smart if not weight its on the heavier side i like light small phones this one is a gift not a deal breaker verdict if you don t want to spend waste your money on expensive phones and buy some needful stuff for you with the money you save you should absolutely go for this beast and beauty redmi is doing justice to its consumer with such competitive phones this phone easily competes with the price range of k phones all in all a must buy for

me highlight the pros and cons pros fingerprint detection is lightning fast battery life is absolutely great miui is much better than their past ui build quality is top notch you can use two sims plus microsd separately at first i was sceptical about mediatek as in the past i encountered a lot of lagging and hanging problems but this processor the speed and performance is the best i have ever used on a budget phone it feels like using the snapdragon series with no problems great job xiaomi i lost my led light controller but thanks to the infrared on this phone i can control my lights now also tv and stuff it s a neat feature cons if your buying this mobile for photography dont buy please under natural light photos look good but under unnatural lights it looks really bad now some might say camera is superb but i guess this is the only phone they have ever used with a camera of this category of smartphones trust me the nokia though old its camera is much much better also the macro lens is pathetic and the selfie too megapixels don t make photos good the   processing software does so xiaomi is still way far behind wifi speed does not exceed mbps for some reason and i did a quick google search many people have same issue phone feels a little too big though it is really nice for watching videos and reading i have used better display than this note pro in its category my issue is with the pixels when your typing your phone you can see the small diodes though i believe it s because i have used better phones and it s a distraction only for me and that i am focusing too much on it conclusion if your a person like me who wants to play games and use whatsapp insta and such and click pictures on the go and don t care much about it big battery good display performance like a beast go for this phone instead of a flagship phone and rather save the money and buy an ipad mini in the future helpful comment report abuse sayan patel superfast gaming multitasking device  ed in

to api out of the box gaming mediatek processor is a blaze was a snapdragon fanboy till this device arrived usb type c for charging and data transfer w fast charging which is definitely a speedy charge for those who haven t experienced it before fingerprint reader is blazing fast so is face unlock cons low light camera performance not that great here camera to api helps w fast charging though is good they could have provided a faster charger speakers don t have punch face unlock is not as secure as a d scanning present in other devices but its acceptable updates seems to be late my view towards this product is that it is a bang for your buck handles games like butter and has no heating issues till now every phone heats up so does this but not anything alarming hours of pubg in hdr

great phone in this budget after a week s time my experience is good except for the battery performance and fingerprint sensor position a battery of new phone having just one day life after full charge is something unexpected keeping in view i am a moderate user and dont play pubg or games secondly position of fingerprint sensor is prehistoric how can designer make such mistake by aligning camera and fingerprint sensor in one single line and that too at the back of the phone this bad alignment ignites chances of contamination of lenses while one tries to unlock phone using finger and yeah not to forget our fingers are often dirty aren t they well now comes camera which is fabulous megapixel does wonders exactly the way manufacturer describes also phone dimensions are little exaggerated but one can always use one handed operation feature and you will start loving the length and breadth of it instantly overall a nice budget phone and worth buy let me know if you would like

expectation i have been using redmi note for last three years such a wonderful phone however due to lack of space and low time of battery i thought to go for a new phone and this redmi note pro has come freshly so i blindly jumped to this i ordered and got it on st december a very fast delivery by amazon however when i started operating the phone its sound and basic settings are just like note with very minor improvement the most disappointing part is its touch of key boards most of the time the touch of the letter keys does not type what you intend to and also very often touch of space key does not create space between words so is the shift of key pad from alphabet to numbers also does not respond quickly there is also a problem such as when you are watching a video and suddenly you have to move to some other work on the phone then navigating keys do not appear on the screen and then you have to switch off the phone sometimes it is non satisfactory phone i dont know whether it is

fast delivery and today after using it for days i am writing this   so who ever want to buy this phone please read this this is an honest   pros helio g t processor is great as it is pretty fast and makes phone snappy you can play pubg on hdr and ultra fps or smooth extreme fps no lag so far and no heating many people were saying it heats a lot and all that stuff but in reality my phone doesn t heat and i play for min hrs daily on smooth extreme and i play with cover so it explains everything that the liquid cooling in it works really well and there is no heating issue it has a massive in hdr enable display which is pretty big and the bezels are too thin you can see only screen and the touch response is great in this phone while playing games like pubg cod etc overall screen is great it comes with quad camera setup the picture taken with it are great and the mp camera does a great job with details and its potrait mode is great too the wide angle camera does a really great job and takes a great field of view and the macro camera actually works and click some really awesome  s and video recording is great too you can record p fps with stabilization and slow motion upto fps you can also record videos on wide angle camera and macro camera and the selfie camera is good too it takes overall good selfies in low light too and natural  s no artificial beautyfy no skin smoothing crap like oppo vivo and realme battery life of this phone is great i get nearly hr of screen on time and it includes hr of cod hr of youtube and all social media apps like instagram whatsapp twitter facebook taking photos and watching anime on chrome for hrs and shopping apps like amazon flipkart myntra club factory etc for hrs and i am done for the day still remaining and it takes hr min to charge from to and i will recommend you not to charge phone over as it is good for battery health in long term and the above data i told you was from battery to get the perfect screen on time fingerprint scanner is pretty fast and reliable and face unlock is great too as it s fast and accurate sorry i can t put pictures i clicked from this phone as they are all personal and private pictures cons because of the hdr support the videos on youtube seems a little whiteish and it annoyed me at the start but i am used to it now it takes min to charge from to the camera bump is too much you can t put your phone on floor on backside or you will get scratch on your camera lens the helio g t processor is based on nm technology so it s not that battery efficient and for now it has no

about months battery life it has a solid battery of mah which you can use for full days with normal usage camera an extremely superb camera works well in all modes be it portrait mode night mode mp mode slow motion video or selfie mode ram and processor i played a few games on it in high resolution and never felt any sort of lagging slowness thanks to the brilliant processor and huge ram also has a game turbo mode that allows you to perform additional functions while playing the game fast charging by type c charger i generally keep my mobile between hence it takes roughly mins to charge within this range gb storage this humongous amount of storage allows installing any apps videos  s without constantly working on removing unnecessary data however the  s taken through this camera being high quality generally take about mb of storage and i think i may need a microsd in the future when videos and  s start piling up design i have a halo white version looks superb both at the back and front gives a brilliant look video quality there is an unnecessary sharpness for videos in medium low quality making the   look very unnatural if previously you have been a samoled user like me the video quality may disappoint you a bit however when the resolution is high ie p the video quality on the whole phone gets too great extension of the camera at the back this is one of the most irritating point in this phone the camera s along with the fingerprint sensor rise a bit above the back s surface even after i applied the cover because of this you cant keep the phone anywhere you want mostly i keep the phone over a small cloth miui superb heating does get a bit heated up when charging or playing game for a very long time hotspot feature there is no limit or monitoring on the devices that can be connected to this phone so upon setting a password it automatically connects disconnects connects disconnects on any random device in near range which can be quite frustrating ads though i already had blocked the ads option initially when i started using the phone but still i receive some ads from some of the inbuilt apps network issues no issues faced till now hence overall its a good phone to buy with minor set backs a really good option if need your phone to be good in the gaming department one person found this helpful helpful comment report abuse previous page next

realme x or the poco x which launched after i purchased this this one is pretty good but as i mentioned above there are better options battery life is good easily lasts a day takes around hours to fully charge from performance has been superb and multitasking seamless camera quality is average don t believe the mp camera hype display is big and very good even though it s an lcd display the

have played most of the heavy games like asphalt and pubg etc touch is flawless and fingerprint is really fast display is big and bright i like it although its not amoled battery is fairly good enough for one day backup with heavy usage charging is fast and gets full charged from to in nearly mins dislikes little heavy u will feel its weight if using single handed gets warm around camera when camera is in continued use for some time also night shots are noisy and lack details ultra wide gives really wide angle but with lesser details unwanted mi apps and ads which u can t stop and uninstall finally note pro is really the best phone by xiaomi in note series till now camera and performance are really fabulous only downside according to me is weight and gets warm around camera one

quality product i love mi   helpful comment report abuse lostinmind zz i finally got my baby  ed in india on june verified purchase i know it s dramatic but i love gadgets i was saving for it for so long i worked in low salary job with the only aim to buy this guy one day i was confused between realme and this one but let me tell you what i found during my endless research redmi offers you what realme is offering in less price maybe it s because the launch delay and the competition between the two i had redmi note before this and it s perfectly fine except of battery drain out and lack of storage i was thinking of trying realme but nope same thing in less price who doesn t want that my focus while looking for a phone was a better camera and tons of storage so things that i liked it has amazing camera dedicated sd card slot with dual sim the colour aka gama green the processor and all that stuff that i don t understand but experts say is great things that i don t like the cameras and fingerprinting sensors are bulking out that makes my ocd brain worry a lot for the lens the camera is important because ai love nature s photography tooooo many in built mi related apps that are just waste of storage and are not that useful i would use mi store if it had everything that a playstore has but it doesn t so it s useless these things are livable but i hope they consider improving it to make the best thanks redmi for making affordable phones helpful comment report abuse yetanotherguy best smartphone of the year  ed in india on january verified purchase true   after using it for days

whiteverified purchase i am writing this   after using the device redmi note pro for about days i must say i am pretty surprised to see the capabilities of this device in this price range first i must mention that gb ram n gb memory rom in k was a steal deal for me the battery lasts for about a day with more than moderate to quite heavy usage if i use it with respect battery lasts for about a day n half easy with about juice left with better t saver it will easily stretch to days with less than moderate usage finger print reader is almost accurate for about out of times it also depends on how perfectly we do the initial scan of finger feel is very smooth and display is crisp n very detailed with a premium feel to the touch and response my only disappointment so far is with the user interface it does not have any app list like in other os miui just let s all apps on home screen making it a clutter so i have to arrange it as per usage a very important thing to mention here is that though i received a fast charger in the box but it does not do quick charge i thought it does not show fast charging but it took about n half to hrs to chanrge using the stock charger then one fine day i used my powerbank which had fast charging and found it was doing a quick charge and did charge full in hrs then i tried it with another charge which i knew was a fast charger and it also charged quick with proper notification on device so here i don t know how i got a duplicate or defective charger in a sealed box but i am disappointed with the charger to a great extent though i can buy a new one or just use charger of another device but this is the main reason i am deducting star thanks for reading hope it helps make ur mind helpful comment report abuse vaibhav mishra beauty and the beast

unbiased   as i am not a mi fan and this is my first mi xiaomi device camera pictures captured in day light normal default mode contain a lot of details mp doesn t need any introduction each mp pic varies from mb to mb in size they have a lotta details when you zoom in portrait shots are awesome too night pics are decent too they are above average not as good as iphone though of course but considering the price it s awesome macro shots are incredibly awesome i mean you can just take a pic from cms focal distance ultra wide lens serves it purpose well but slightly fades out the colors the pic from ultrawide in daylight are very good but indoor lighting are not that sharp and a little bit of lack color saturation hope xiaomi fix it in updates speaker sound quality is great crisp and clear it cannot be compared with stereo speakers mobiles like oneplus t or s but yes considering that it is a single grill firing speaker the quality is decent and it s loud enough network strength no issues at all everything works fine no call drops no speed issue but note pro isn t giving me g carrier aggregation signals don t know why maybe network operator issue or maybe it doesn t support indian operators g g works perfectly display it can t be compared with amoled or s amoled but i just wanna say i simply don t care it is bright and colors are sharp and contrast is very good it supports hdr useful only when you watch hdr content battery mah is enough for a moderate user for watching videos whatsapp fb etc will easily give you around days with still some juice left if you are a heavy user then it might give you hrs backup if you use continuously design superb it s hot no doubt back is just awesome and gives you a premium feeling when you hold this phone build the device is around grams it is a bit heavy but trust me you will get used to it and after days you won t even feel that it s heavy it s just getting used to it positioning of fingerprint sensor is inaccurate and sometimes you might touch the rd camera lens above the sensor but again you will get used to it camera bump is there so use a good quality case to protect it performance helio g t gb ram minimum cmon it won t show you any lags it s buttery smooth even for gamers yes this chipset cannot be compared with snapdragon but still after one level all are decent ones ram management is decent too and

before diwali but quick delivery was not available sed life for me tho i recieved it a day after diwali the phone is awesome overall yes you might get slower charging heating issues while playing heavy games but they re not so problematic you can adjust also the quad camera is just a marketing term just the main sensor and telephoto sensors are worthy ultra wide and macro lens quality is bad

i will return it   helpful comment report abuse rajat sharma great value for money couldn t ask for anything else go for it  ed in india on january verified purchase at the given price we couldn t ask for anything more than what this phone offers but there are a few flaws which needs to be highlighted too the vibration alert is literally very less and i often miss several calls it s difficult to realise while walking on a quiet road and impossible while riding a bike the speakers are also just okay and again feels inadequate to hear the ringtones while in a noisy environment so be prepared for it if you spend a lot of your time while out there in the traffic the camera specs looks great on the paper but are totally overrated forget about zooming into your mp photographs and getting the flawless details which the company was boasting of during normal usage the camera produces good photographs while the x zoom is useless also the ultra wide shot loses several details so there wouldn t be any point in clicking a noisy photograph low light performance is just okay with loss of details but not satisfactory rest assured if you re in properly lit environment and the subject is right in front of you the camera is surely going to produce some very good photographs the battery life is okay for max days of normal usage the led indicator on the top is quite dim and wouldn t get your attention unless you look for it the screen doesn t light up properly if you re out during the day and take out your phone to attend a call you ll need to turn off the screen and then again turn it on by pressing the power button to see who s calling you the proximity sensor doesn t work properly after you re done with the phone call and want to disconnect the call the screen wouldn t turn on when you remove the phone from your ear again you would ve to press tbe power button twice to turn the screen on again it surely is a phone with a great value for money but xiaomi shouldn t promote it like it s the best one in the world especially that mp camera the quad camera setup needs better software integration for better performance i guess helpful comment report abuse bikash ranjan dash need to

abuse amazon customer outstanding phone but for this massive lapse  ed in india on november verified purchase i had bought the mi note pro for the first time on nov however having set up the device i started facing issues with the headphone jack every single time i connected any aux device to the phone the connection was intermittently interrupted and the music media would automatically pause for that reason thus creating issues with continuous playback pursuant to the same i got a replacement done and received a new device however i am still facing the same connectivity issues with the aux jack with no immediate remedy in sight it seems most probably a software issue however quite disappointing to have to face this on a new mi device perhaps and hopefully the same may get remedied with

like when we hotdrop mean if we surrounded with many enemys then the fps will dropped below fps but all over the gaming experience is good but also in the higher graphics setting the phone gets heated upto degree that not a big problem because it will cool down immediately after putting phone idle for minutes so the liquid cooling helps to reduce the temperature fastly pros the battery life of the is good if you are a light user then it will runs upto and a half day for a heavy user the battery will last upto day the design of this phone is really amazing and also in the hand it will feel like a premium phone both the front and the back is protected with the gorilla glass this phone has a led notification light and also it has a ir blaster which i personally liked it all over the gaming experience is smooth in this phone the mp camera will takes a good photos the front mp shooter is also pretty good a bigger screen of inches which provides a better experience in gaming ip rating for dustproof and splash proof this phone has a good processor helio g t the score of this phone is above k cons the speaker quality is below average the brightness of this phone low company should provide the super amoled display video recording of this phone is very poor while gaming at highest graphics the phone will started heating the camera bump is too big if we put a back case on it then
